# Everything You Need to Know About the Pyth Network

Share:

Decentralized finance (DeFi) promises to revolutionize the way we manage our
money and empower individuals to take control of their financial lives. The
vast majority of DeFi services require a [blockchain
oracle](https://pyth.network/blog/what-is-a-blockchain-oracle?ref=pyth-
network.ghost.io)—a secure, reliable method for blockchain applications to
obtain financial data from the external world.

Enter the **Pyth Network** , the largest first-party oracle network for
publishing financial market data on-chain. The network sources its data from
over 90 [first-party data
providers](https://pyth.network/publishers/?ref=pyth-network.ghost.io),
including some of the biggest exchanges and market makers. Pyth offers [real-
time price feeds](https://pyth.network/price-feeds/?ref=pyth-network.ghost.io)
for cryptocurrencies, equities, foreign exchange pairs, ETFs, and commodities
to smart contract developers on more than 40 blockchains.

Since [April 2021](https://pyth.network/blog/introducing-pyth-
network?ref=pyth-network.ghost.io), the contributors of the Pyth Network have
been working to provide Web3 developers with hundreds of real-time price
feeds. The mission is to make all of the world's financial market data
available on the blockchain for developers everywhere.

With the blockchain industry moving towards a future of high throughput DeFi,
there is a rapidly growing demand for low-latency, high-frequency on-chain
data. This blog post delves into the Pyth Network’s role in enabling this
transformation.

* * *

## **Why Do We Need Another Oracle?**

The Pyth Network is not the first blockchain oracle. The contributors behind
Pyth began this project in DeFi Summer of 2020 because they noticed a gap in
blockchain infrastructure that held back the promises of the blockchain space.
Simply put, a price oracle for ultra-low-latency, institutional-quality market
data did not exist. Web3 developers felt this gap in three ways:

**1\. Speed: Oracles were not updating fast enough for many financial use
cases.**

If prices on the blockchain are slower than real-world markets, then DeFi
services will be inaccurate and even vulnerable to malicious attacks. These
restrictions prevent developers from building sophisticated financial
services. At the time, price oracles only updated every 10-60 minutes or
‘heartbeat’, which cannot support use cases that require low-latencies and
high-frequency updates.

**2\. Coverage and Availability: Developers did not have access to the price
feeds they needed.**

Developers need access to certain assets or markets to serve their users.
Developers cannot deliver financial services if the relevant price feeds are
not available on their blockchain of choice. Legacy oracles could have e.g.
200 price feeds on Ethereum but only 8 on a newer chain like Base. The same
oracle could also support multiple chains but have only a few price feeds that
are available on _all_ supported chain. These limitations can delay a
protocol’s roadmap.

**3\. Sourcing and Quality: Data was opaque and came from aggregated, third-
party sources.**

Price oracles can be responsible for securing billions of dollars of smart
contract value. But if the ultimate source of their data is opaque, developers
and users cannot trust the quality of the prices they receive. Additionally,
it will be difficult to hold these sources accountable for their prices,
especially if the oracle is collecting these prices from public aggregator
services or scraping services. Developers must be able to verify the inputs
from their oracle's data sources and understand the reputations at stake.

## How Pyth Works

### **The Legacy Model for Data Distribution**

The Pyth Network is designed to solve these three limitations. These
shortcomings arose because traditional oracles were designed based on a
fundamental misunderstanding of how financial data works.

The implicit premise behind many legacy oracles is that all data, including
financial data, is freely available in the Web2 space. According to this
approach, the oracle provider simply needs to [incentivize network
participants](https://pyth.network/blog/publisher-vs-reporter-
networks?ref=pyth-network.ghost.io) to fetch this data, come to a consensus,
and bring it on-chain.

A network of nodes will collect or scrape data from public resources,
including aggregators compiling third-party data from other undisclosed
sources. This method of data sourcing may work for public datasets such as
weather or sports data. However, when it comes to financial data, the oracle
must make compromises in terms of data quality, costs, and scaling.
Furthermore, some financial data cannot be redistributed freely due to IP
laws.

![](https://pyth-network.ghost.io/content/images/2023/11/pyth_data_model.png)

Consider the financial exchange industry. In 2022, the largest traditional
exchanges earned $6.6B in total for data fees _alone_. Subscriptions to
professional data terminals like Bloomberg costs tens of thousands of dollars
per year. Even crypto exchanges like Coinbase have started charging for market
data. The financial data industry operates as a walled garden.

The alternative solution—non-paywalled data—is either delayed for free users
or aggregated by freemium services not tailored for smart contracts. Legacy
oracles cannot access the first type of valuable data without violating IP
laws. Smart contract developers therefore get the second-best data, at the
expense of DeFi users.

### **A New Model for Data Distribution**

The Pyth Network is built on the understanding that financial data is valuable
and not freely attainable. Instead of serving a rough approximation of this
data, the Pyth protocol empowers and incentivizes _original owners_ of
financial data to contribute it directly to the blockchain. The network’s data
sources are called “first-party” because they create and own the data that
they contribute.

![](https://pyth-
network.ghost.io/content/images/2023/11/pyth_data_model-1.png)

It is helpful to visualize Pyth as a decentralized marketplace for market
data. On the one side, creators of proprietary data represent the suppliers.
Applications using this data represent the consumers. In the same way that
Airbnb brought more vacation homes and spare rooms to the travel industry,
Pyth Network unlocks more high-quality data for the blockchain industry by
incentivizing data owners to contribute.

### The Future of DeFi is First-Party

One might ask why Pyth Network’s architecture will remain the industry’s new
go-to financial oracle. The answer lies in the long-term implications of
first-party price data.

Pyth Network’s first-party data model future-proofs it for DeFi’s expansion
into new asset classes such as energy, treasury rates, and real-world assets
which do not have free-to-access equivalents online. The distribution rights
that come with Pyth's first-party data provider community ensure that the
network is prepared for DeFi's expansion. If DeFi grows to serve millions or
even billions of users, we should expect that it will offer new markets.
Oracles need to be where DeFi grows.

A helpful illustration of these different architectures is to think of [music
streaming services](https://pyth.network/blog/pyth-the-spotify-of-
crypto?ref=pyth-network.ghost.io). Reporter oracle networks are analogous to
Napster, where CD purchases act as network nodes who purchase instances of the
original music and distribute it to the Internet of listeners.

![](https://pyth-network.ghost.io/content/images/2023/11/napster_model.png)

Napster faced severe legal consequences and spam attacks because of this
model. Spotify provided a streamlined solution where musicians and record
labels can directly stream to subscribers and earn from the platform’s
economics. Pyth is analogous to Spotify in its acknowledgment and rewarding of
owners of intellectual property—in this case, financial data.

![](https://pyth-network.ghost.io/content/images/2023/11/spotify_model.png)

Pyth Network is the largest _**publisher**  **oracle**  **network**_  with
over 90 first-party data sources publishing directly to the network. In this
network, the nodes own and publish their data directly on-chain.

Because Pyth’s data providers are the owners of the data they contribute, the
financial data can be freely distributed across the blockchain space and
beyond. This data distribution model also maximizes access to information and
removes middlemen costs for data consumers. The design brings speed and cost
advantages which enables Pyth to scale to thousands of symbols and near
limitless blockchains in coverage.

In contrast, most legacy oracles are _**reporter**  **oracle**  **network**_ ,
where nodes carry data over the last mile from API endpoint to on-chain
consumption. In this network design, the nodes must purchase the data from
first-party sources or other middlemen for transmission. These networks are
constrained by the cost, speeds, and output formats of the purchased data. You
can learn more about the sustainability differences between publisher and
reporter oracle networks [here](https://pyth.network/blog/publisher-vs-
reporter-networks?ref=pyth-network.ghost.io).

Although there is no single right way to design an oracle network, the Pyth
Network is designed to scale without speed, pricing, or distribution
constraints. The goal is to enable the next generation of Web3 capital
markets.

The next section breaks down the Pyth Network to its core components to help
illustrate how its core products work.

* * *

## **The Pyth Network Components**

The Pyth Network allows market participants to publish pricing information on-
chain for applications to use. The protocol is an interaction between:

  1. **Data providers**  submit pricing information to Pyth's oracle program. Pyth has multiple data publishers for every product to improve the accuracy and robustness of the system.
  2. **The** **Pyth protocol**  combines providers' data to produce a single aggregate price and confidence interval.
  3. **Data users**  read the price information produced by the oracle program.

It is important to understand that the Pyth Network itself is not a source of
data. Data providers supply data to the network, and data users demand this
data. The Pyth protocol, as a decentralized marketplace, aggregates the data
providers’ contributed data in preparation for delivery to applications across
multiple blockchains.

network.ghost.io/content/images/2023/11/pyth_protocol_model.png)

### **Data Providers**

The Pyth Network [data provider
community](https://pyth.network/publishers?ref=pyth-network.ghost.io) is
comprised of global exchanges, trading firms, market makers, and other
institutional as well as decentralized market participants. These providers
are the creators, and therefore owners, of their price data. The data
providers contribute their idea of the price of assets e.g.
[Bitcoin](https://pyth.network/price-feeds/crypto-btc-usd?ref=pyth-
network.ghost.io) to the network for the Pyth Price Feeds.

Though it may seem counter-intuitive, there is no [single true
price](https://pyth.network/blog/pyth-network-wants-to-go-fast?ref=pyth-
network.ghost.io) of an asset. There is the price you **can** trade an asset
at, which is generated by exchanges; and there is the most recent transaction
price of that asset, which is generated by traders. Pyth’s data provider
community specializes in these [two types of price
data](https://pyth.network/blog/pyth-and-financial-market-data?ref=pyth-
network.ghost.io).

### **The Pyth Protocol**

The Pyth protocol aggregates the data providers' inputs to produce a single
aggregate price and confidence interval every 400ms for each price feed. This
aggregation mechanism lives on an application-specific blockchain called
[**Pythnet**](https://pyth.network/blog/introducing-pythnet?ref=pyth-
network.ghost.io).

Consider the symbol [BTC/USD](https://pyth.network/price-feeds/crypto-btc-
usd?ref=pyth-network.ghost.io). Each provider reports both their price and a
confidence interval estimate for Bitcoin to the BTC/USD price feed on Pyth.
For example, a provider may provide a price of $30,000 ± $5. Multiple
providers contribute their inputs for any price feed, resulting in a robust,
accurate output.

Pythnet is configured to be a proof-of-authority chain. It runs a version of
the Solana validator and is a completely separate network from Solana mainnet-
beta. The Pythnet appchain processes data from various providers, combining
their inputs to produce a unified price and confidence interval for each price
feed.

The [aggregation algorithm](https://pyth.network/blog/pyth-price-aggregation-
proposal?ref=pyth-network.ghost.io) is designed to make each price feed robust
to outliers and manipulation, weigh each data source appropriately based on
their accuracy, and reflect variations between data providers’ prices an
aggregate confidence band. The aggregate outputs are then streamed to Wormhole
in preparation for dApps to use: the result is a signed price payload that can
be verified on any chain where Pyth is supported. You can read more about the
aggregation methodology [here](https://docs.pyth.network/documentation/how-
pyth-works/price-aggregation?ref=pyth-network.ghost.io).

### **Data Users**

Data users on any Pyth-supported blockchain can read the price feeds and
incorporate the data into their smart contract logic.

Pyth Network introduces a unique architecture called the [Pull
Oracle](https://pyth.network/blog/pyth-a-new-model-to-the-price-
oracle?ref=pyth-network.ghost.io). With the Pull Oracle design, data users can
“pull” or request a price update from the Pyth protocol when needed. This
architecture is gas efficient because users only pay for prices they want.

Thanks to this design, decentralized applications can request a new price
update from the Pyth protocol **_when needed_**. A user would submit the
signed price payload to the Pyth contract on their blockchain, which verifies
its validity, and then use the resulting price. This process allows Pyth price
updates to reach any supported blockchain.

In contrast, legacy oracles are typically designed as Push Oracles. These
oracles run an off-chain process to “push” price updates on-chain at a regular
interval. This model can waste gas fees on unused price updates. The
inefficiency of push oracles can lead to gas subsidy requirements, infrequent
updates, and difficulties landing prices on-chain during network congestion.

The Pyth protocol allows data users to request and consume on-chain price
updates for a small [data
fee](https://docs.pyth.network/documentation/pythnet-price-feeds/on-
demand?ref=pyth-network.ghost.io#fees). Pyth users pull sends tens of millions
of price updates cross-chain every month onto the various supported
blockchains. While data fees are currently set to the smallest denomination of
the blockchain’s native currency (e.g. 1 wei), this fee parameter and others
can be determined by future governance.

Common [use cases](https://pyth.network/consumers?ref=pyth-network.ghost.io)
of Pyth data include spot and derivatives exchanges, structured product
vaults, borrow/lending platforms, stablecoin protocols, yield optimizers,
asset management solutions, and data analytics. You have probably used a
[Powered by
Pyth](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23poweredbypyth&src=typed_query&ref=pyth-
network.ghost.io) application. Notable names include Synthetix (Optimism),
Vela Exchange (Arbitrum and Base), Alpaca Finance (BNB Chain), Solend
(Solana), and [many more](https://pyth.network/consumers?ref=pyth-
network.ghost.io).

## **The Pyth Network Products**

The Pyth Network currently offers two flagship products for DeFi applications:
Pyth Price Feeds and Pyth Benchmarks.

Integration with Pyth data is permissionless, meaning developers can access
Pyth data without entering a subscription or engaging a sales team. This
design choice reflects the network’s commitment to the Web3 ethos.

### **Pyth Price Feeds**

The Pyth Network offers over 350 low-latency [price
feeds](https://pyth.network/price-feeds?ref=pyth-network.ghost.io) across
cryptocurrencies, FX rates, equities, ETFs, and commodities. Each price feed
updates once every 400ms: high-frequency updates mean the prices closely track
the external markets to granular intervals. High resolution data is important
for time- and price-sensitive applications.

Every Pyth Price Feed provides the spot price and a [confidence
interval](https://pyth.network/blog/what-is-confidence?ref=pyth-
network.ghost.io), visualized as a band around the price. The confidence
interval represents the range in which the data providers (_in aggregate_)
believe the true price is likely to be. This confidence value informs data
users about the strength of the price output. Data providers can adjust their
confidence based on the liquidity environment, and smart contracts can use
this information for safer operations.

### **Pyth Benchmarks**

[Pyth Benchmarks](https://pyth.network/benchmarks?ref=pyth-network.ghost.io)
allow users to query a historical archive of prices from the Pyth Price Feeds.
Benchmarks are [class of standards](https://pyth.network/blog/introducing-the-
pyth-benchmarks?ref=pyth-network.ghost.io) used in finance to guide decisions
and settle payouts. Examples include reference prices like the Bitcoin
reference rate, indices like the S&P500, and rates such as LIBOR or the Fed
Funds Rate.

Pyth Benchmarks provide standardization in calculations and presentation,
ensuring consistent measurements for settlement and valuation. Common use
cases for Pyth Benchmarks include decentralized options vaults (DOVs), such as
Aevo on Ethereum, and backfilling prices for perpetual trading settlement,
such as Synthetix on Optimism.

## **Addressing the Limitations of Legacy Oracles**

How do Pyth Network’s products address the issues of speed, asset coverage,
and accuracy of legacy oracles? The key is Pyth Network’s architectural
innovation of the [Pull Oracle](https://pyth.network/blog/pyth-a-new-model-to-
the-price-oracle?ref=pyth-network.ghost.io). This efficiency brings a number
of advantages in latency, scalability, and data resolution.

![](https://pyth-network.ghost.io/content/images/2023/11/pyth_pull_model.png)

### **1\. Low-Latency, High-Frequency Updates**

**High Update Frequencies** —The Pythnet appchain updates each Pyth Price Feed
multiple times per second. The output is streamed to Wormhole and data users
can listen to this data stream through a public API. Pushing every price on-
chain would make frequent updates like this impractical. However, push oracles
usually update even less frequently than the blocktime due to the high cost of
more frequent updates.

**Low-Latencies** —Pythnet streams price updates at a high frequency off-chain
so that decentralized applications can use the most recent off-chain price for
every transaction. This outcome means fresher prices than relying on a last
on-chain update pushed by an oracle.

### **2\. Price Feed Coverage and Multi-Chain Availability**

**Broad Asset Selection** —The technical capabilities of Pythnet enables the
Pyth protocol to scale to thousands of price feeds. This is thanks to Solana’s
specialization in high-throughput and ultra-cheap transactions.

**Multi-Chain Availability** —The Pyth Network's price feeds are accessible on
all Pyth-supported blockchains by default, since price sourcing and
aggregation occur on Pythnet, and the price updates are brought cross-chain
through Wormhole. When a new Pyth Price Feed launches, it is immediately
available on all supported blockchains, eliminating the need for individual
deployments on each target chain. This makes Pyth an interesting oracle for
launching new data feeds, as Pyth can instantly expand price exposure for an
asset to dozens of blockchains.

### **3\. High-Resolution, High-Fidelity, Transparent Data**

**Accurate, First-Party Prices** —Pyth sources data from traditional and
decentralized creators of financial data. One key advantage of Pyth’s focus on
first-party data is price accuracy. Pyth’s data providers are active
participants in price discovery: they truly know the prices of assets. Pyth is
designed to incentivize these data owners to contribute their private price
data and aggregate these inputs to yield an accurate, representative snapshot
of the markets.

**Transparent Aggregation** —The Pyth Network’s aggregation mechanism is
designed to be transparent and verifiable. The provenance of each data point
can be traced back to the public keys of the data providers. The aggregation
and delivery process is publicly auditable using widely available tools like
the Solana block explorer and the Pyth Publisher Metrics.

**Reputational Alignment** —Pyth’s data providers include established
businesses in the traditional finance world and the blockchain industry. It is
against their economic interest to attempt to influence the oracle unfairly,
as their price inputs are public and they would incur reputational loss to
their main commercial activities. In addition to this alignment is the
aggregation mechanism, which prevents a minority of data providers from
tampering the price.

* * *

## **Ecosystem and Governance**

The Pyth Network ecosystem spans a diverse range of stakeholders, from data
owners to decentralized applications to individual blockchain participants.
On-chain governance is critical for a protocol’s self-sustainability and
decentralization. As discussed in a [previous
blog](https://pyth.network/blog/understanding-the-pyth-tokenomics?ref=pyth-
network.ghost.io) on the Pyth Network’s tokenomics, governance structures are
generally established to enable community guidance of a protocol’s
development.

Governance is expected to be responsible for actions such as determining the
parameters of update fees, the reward distribution mechanism for data
providers, and determining how products are listed on Pyth and their reference
data. You can read the [whitepaper](https://pyth.network/whitepaper?ref=pyth-
network.ghost.io) to learn more.

## **Summary**

The Pyth Network contributors understood that past oracles were founded on a
mistaken assumption on how financial data works. Legacy oracles served the
nascent stages of DeFi well. But they also admitted of limitations in latency,
asset coverage, and data quality, which restricted DeFi’s growth.

The future of price oracles is not searching for and bringing prices to the
blockchain: it is bringing price owners and creators to DeFi. The Pyth
Network’s Pull Oracle architecture addresses these core limitations.

The Pyth Network’s products are permissionless, transparent, low-latency,
high-fidelity, and are designed to scale with the growth of Web3 itself. We’re
excited for you to join the Pyth Network journey. There’s much to build.
