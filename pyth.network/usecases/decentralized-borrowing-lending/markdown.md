ORACLE FOR BORROW/LENDING

# Building  
Decentralized Lending

This guide covers the different types of borrow/lending services, the nuances
of different interest rate models, and how borrow/lending platforms use oracle
prices.

## What is Borrow/Lending?

Borrowing and lending (or ''borrow/lending'') refers to one of the most
popular primitives in decentralized finance. Borrow/lending services enables
individuals to lend out their assets and earn interest or borrow assets by
providing collateral.

Borrow/lending is an important primitive for decentralized finance as it
enables capital efficiency by making idle assets productive and efficient
price discovery by allowing users to access liquidity to capitalize on market
or arbitrage opportunities.

### Borrowing and Lending in Practice

In the borrowing process, users lock up collateral (usually in the form of
cryptocurrencies or tokens) into a smart contract. By posting collateral, they
can borrow other assets up to a certain value based on the collateral's market
worth and the contract's predefined parameters.

On the lending side, users can participate as lenders by depositing their
assets into a lending pool managed by a smart contract. These assets are then
available for borrowers to use as collateral for their loans.

By borrowing assets, users gain exposure to various digital assets without
needing to own them outright. Conversely, lenders have the opportunity to earn
interest by lending out their assets to borrowers.

Borrow/lending protocols in DeFi require [real-time oracle
data](https://pyth.network/blog/what-is-a-blockchain-oracle) to determine the
[price of assets](https://pyth.network/blog/pyth-and-financial-market-data)
used as collateral, calculate interest rates, and trigger liquidations when
necessary to preserve the 'health' or solvency of the protocol.

## Borrow/Lending:  
How Does It Work?

Borrowing and lending in DeFi involve users locking up cryptocurrency
collateral to obtain loans or provide loans, with smart contracts automating
interest calculation, repayment enforcement, and collateral management.

### Loan Origination

Loan origination refers to the process of creating a new loan within a lending
protocol. When a borrower wants to borrow cryptocurrency assets, they interact
with the protocol's smart contract to initiate the loan. The smart contract
calculates the maximum amount the borrower can borrow based on the value of
the collateral they provide.

### Collateralization System

Lending platforms need to protect lenders from bad debt. For this reason, a
collateralization mechanism is essential for managing risk. A
collateralization ratio dictates how much they can borrow. Borrowers must
maintain a sufficient collateral-to-loan ratio to avoid liquidation by
providing collateral worth more than the borrowed amount.

This collateral acts as a safeguard for lenders, mitigating the risk of
default. Margin requirement varies based on the platform and asset involved.
Higher volatility assets often necessitate higher margin requirements to
account for potential price fluctuations.

### Interest Calculation

Interest calculation involves determining the amount of interest that
borrowers need to repay on their borrowed funds. The interest rate is usually
specified when the loan is originated. The smart contract calculates the
interest amount based on the borrowed principal and the interest rate over the
loan term.

### Liquidation Mechanism

If the value of the collateral falls below a specified threshold, the smart
contract can automatically liquidate the borrower's position to protect the
lender's funds. To maintain the collateral's value relative to the borrowed
asset, decentralized lending platforms implement mechanisms for monitoring
loan-to-value (LTV) ratios.

Liquidations are integral to preserving the stability of decentralized lending
platforms. When a borrower's collateral value breaches the predetermined LTV
ratio, the platform may initiate liquidation by auctioning the borrower's
collateral. This allows lenders to recover their funds while minimizing
losses. Lenders or arbitrageurs can participate in these auctions and bid on
the collateral using platform-native tokens.

Some platforms implement incentivized mechanisms to encourage users to monitor
and initiate liquidations when necessary. These users can earn rewards for
maintaining the health of the platform and ensuring adequate
collateralization.

## Interest Rates Models

Borrowers typically pay interest on their loans, which is distributed as
earnings to the lenders in the lending pool. The interest rates are
dynamically determined by supply and demand dynamics within the lending
platform. This section explores the most common models.

### Algorithmic Model

Algorithmic interest rates are determined by automated algorithms based on the
supply and demand dynamics of the platform. These algorithms take into account
factors such as the utilization rate of assets, available liquidity, and
market conditions to adjust interest rates dynamically. Algorithmic interest
rates aim to maintain balance and stability within the lending and borrowing
market.

### Order Book Model

Order books match bid and ask orders according to price-time priority and can
facilitate the determination of interest rates for borrow/lending
transactions. Similar to traditional financial markets, borrowers and lenders
submit their desired borrowing or lending terms, such as the desired interest
rate and loan duration, to an order book. The matching of borrowers and
lenders occurs based on these submitted orders, with interest rates being
determined through the interaction of supply and demand.

### Governance-Based

Governance-determined rates determine interest rates through decentralized
governance mechanisms. Users who hold governance tokens can participate in
voting or decision-making processes to set or adjust interest rates. This
approach allows the community to collectively determine the rates based on
factors such as platform sustainability, market conditions, and user
sentiment.

### Fixed (Stable) Rates

Fixed or stable rates are often predetermined or pegged to external reference
rates. These rates remain constant over a specified period, providing
borrowers and lenders with predictability and stability in terms of interest
payments and earnings.

### Dynamic Rates

Dynamic pricing models for interest rates consider a range of factors such as
asset volatility, risk profiles, and supply-demand dynamics. These models
determine interest rates based on factors such as asset volatility, liquidity
metrics, risk assessment, real-time market data such as trading volume. The
calculated interest rate changes according to market conditions and platform
parameters.

## Shared Pools and Isolated Pools

Borrow/lending protocols can adopt different pool models based on their risk
management objectives.

### Isolated Pools

In an isolated pool model, each user's collateral and borrowing position are
managed separately, creating individualized and isolated pools of assets. The
collateral and borrowing of one user do not affect or interact with the
collateral and borrowing of other platform users.

### Shared Pools

In a shared pool or communal pool model, the collateral and borrowing
positions are pooled together, creating a shared pool of assets. In this
model, all users' collateral and borrowing interact with each other within the
same pool: the assets contributed as collateral by different users are
combined, and the borrowing needs of users are fulfilled from the shared pool
of assets.

By using a shared pool model, borrow/lending protocols can enhance liquidity,
optimize capital utilization, and create potential economies of scale. This
model allows for more efficient allocation of assets and a larger pool of
available liquidity. However, it also introduces potential risks and
complexities related to the shared exposure and interactions among users'
positions.

## Borrow/Lending Models

There are different categories of DeFi borrow/lending services which generally
vary based on the source of yield and how interest rates are calculated.

### Money Markets

Money market protocols enable users to lend and borrow various assets by
creating liquidity pools on-chain. These platforms allow borrowers to
collateralize their assets and borrow other assets from the pool, while
lenders supply liquidity by depositing their assets into the pool and earning
interest.

### Peer-to-Peer (P2P)

Peer-to-peer lending platforms facilitate direct borrowing and lending between
individuals. These platforms connect borrowers and lenders, allowing them to
negotiate terms such as interest rates, collateral requirements, and loan
durations without intermediaries.

### Yield Farming

Yield farming platforms provide opportunities for users to earn additional
yields by leveraging their existing assets for DeFi activities. Users can
deposit their assets into liquidity pools or yield farming protocols, where
they are utilized for yield-bearing activities such as providing liquidity or
participating in governance. In return, users receive additional rewards for
their deposits.

### Flash Loans

Flash loan platforms enable users to borrow funds temporarily without
collateral, as long as the loan is repaid within the same transaction block.
The flexibility of flash loans allow users to exploit arbitrage opportunities
or execute complex trading strategies.

### Synthetic Borrow/Lending

Synthetic asset platforms offer the ability to create and trade synthetic
assets that mirror the value of real-world assets. Users can borrow and lend
these synthetic assets, allowing them to gain exposure to traditional
financial instruments or unique assets within the DeFi ecosystem.

## How Borrow/Lending Services  
Use Oracles

This section explores how decentralized borrow/lending protocols rely on price
oracles to obtain real-time and accurate price information for the assets
involved in lending transactions.

### Collateral Valuation

Loan-to-value (LTV) ratios represent the proportion of the loan amount to the
value of the collateral provided. Price oracles provide real-time asset
prices, which are essential for determining the collateral's value accurately.
Borrow/lending protocols utilize these price feeds to calculate the LTV ratio
by dividing the loan amount by the current market value of the collateral.
This calculation ensures that borrowers maintain sufficient collateralization
throughout the loan term.

### Liquidation Triggers

Decentralized borrow/lending protocols typically set a predetermined threshold
for the LTV ratio. If the LTV ratio exceeds this threshold, indicating a
potential risk of default, the protocol triggers a liquidation process. Price
oracles play a crucial role in determining when the collateral value falls
below the threshold by providing updated asset prices. Once triggered, the
protocol initiates the liquidation by auctioning off the collateral to recover
the lender's funds.

### Interest Rate Determination

Price oracles supply accurate and real-time asset prices that borrow/lending
protocols incorporate into their interest rate models. These models consider
supply and demand dynamics, asset volatility, and other factors to dynamically
adjust interest rates. Price oracles ensure that the protocols have [reliable,
up-to-date market data](https://docs.pyth.network/documentation) to calculate
interest rates that accurately reflect the prevailing market conditions. This
helps create fair and competitive rates that attract borrowers and incentivize
lenders to participate.

### Collateral Swaps and Rebalancing

Some borrow/lending protocols allow users to swap or rebalance their
collateral during the loan term. Price oracles provide real-time asset prices
that enable users to make informed decisions about collateral swaps, ensuring
fair exchange rates and adequate collateralization throughout the process.
Access to real-time and trustless price data is critical for all of these
operations. The accuracy, granularity, and latency of oracle prices are
paramount for protocol security, as inaccurate pricing can cause bad debt or
wrongful liquidations.

Oracles like Pyth specialize in [low-latency price
feeds](https://pyth.network/price-feeds) which
[aggregate](https://pyth.network/blog/pyth-price-aggregation-proposal) across
multiple exchanges and liquidity venues to provide a price output reflective
of the overall market.

Pyth is also the only oracle which provides [confidence
intervals](https://pyth.network/blog/what-is-confidence), or confidence bands
around the reported price which reflect the level of price divergence and
volatility across the markets. A wider confidence band (e.g. BTC/USD at
$30,000 ± $100 instead of ± $10) indicates greater divergence or “uncertainty”
between venues. Borrow/lending platforms can use this confidence data to
inform their on-chain operations and adjust protocol parameters to protect
users and funds.
