Oracle for Decentralized Options

# Building On-Chain Options  and DOVs

This high-level guide outlines the common design variations of on-chain
options and how they use oracles in their pricing and settlement.

hero.353bab08.png&w=3840&q=75)![hero](/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Foptions-
hero.353bab08.png&w=3840&q=75)

## What are Decentralized Options?

Decentralized options have gained significant popularity within the
decentralized finance ecosystem. Options grant traders the right, but not the
obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price, or
strike price, within a specified timeframe. This flexibility allows traders to
explore various strategies based on their market outlook.

### Decentralized Options in Practice

Options are popular instruments because they enable traders to gain exposure
to the price volatility of the asset and express directional views on [price
movements](https://pyth.network/blog/pyth-and-financial-market-data).
Decentralized options typically execute the option creation and settlement
process on-chain.

The recent popularity of decentralized options emerged from their ability to
offer customization for traders with varying risk profiles, enabling them to
tailor positions to specific strategies. Traders can adjust parameters such as
strike prices and expiration dates and combine multiple options or derivatives
to execute an options strategy. Traders typically use options to achieve the
following:

### Risk Management

Options can act as insurance against adverse price movements. Participants can
use put options to protect their holdings from significant losses if the
market goes down.

### Leveraged Positions

Options allow participants to gain leveraged exposure to an asset's price
movement without needing to put up the full value of the asset as collateral.

### Income Generation

Selling covered call options can generate income for participants who hold the
underlying asset. They earn premiums from traders purchasing the options.

### Speculation

Options enable participants to speculate on price movements without actually
owning the underlying asset. They can profit from price increases (call
options) or decreases (put options).

Blockchain oracles play a crucial role in the price determination of on-chain

## Decentralized Options How do they Work?

We outline the essential elements of options pricing and their basic
mechanisms below.

### Call Options

Call options grant the holder the right (but not the obligation) to buy an
asset at a predetermined price (strike) before a specified date (expiration).
As the asset's price rises above the strike, the call option becomes more
valuable.

### Put Options

Put options offer the holder the right (but not the obligation) to sell an
asset at a predetermined price (strike) before a specified date (expiration).
As the asset's price falls below the strike, the put option gains value.

### Underlying

The underlying asset refers to the asset on which the option derives its
value. It can be a stock, cryptocurrency, commodity, or any other tradable
asset. The price movements and volatility of the underlying asset directly
impact the value of the option.

### Strike Price

Strike price (or exercise price) is a predetermined price at which the
underlying asset can be bought or sold when exercising the option. It plays a
significant role in determining the potential profitability of an option
contract.

### Expiry

The expiry date represents the date on which the option contract expires. It
is the last day on which the option can be exercised. Options with longer
expiration periods tend to have higher premiums due to the extended time
value.

### Intrinsic Value

The intrinsic value of an option is the difference between the current price
of the underlying asset and the strike price. For a call option, the intrinsic
value is the positive difference between the underlying asset price and the
strike price, while for a put option, it is the positive difference between
the strike price and the underlying asset price.

An option is considered “in-the-money” when the current price of the
underlying asset is favorable for the option holder. The option is “out-of-
the-money” or “at-the-money” when the current price is not favorable for the
holder or equal to the strike price.

### Extrinsic Value

The extrinsic value of an option is the difference between its premium and its
intrinsic value. Extrinsic value is also known as time value, as it represents
the additional value of the option beyond its intrinsic value and accounts for
factors such as time until expiration and market volatility. It reflects the
probability that the option will increase in value before expiration.

### The Greeks

Option prices are influenced by the underlying's price, strike price, time to
expiry, market volatility, and a number of other factors known as “The
Greeks.”

##### Delta

Measures how much an option's price changes with a $1 change in the underlying
asset.

##### Gamma

Reflects the rate of change of an option's delta.

##### Theta

Gauges how much an option's value decreases with each passing day.

##### Vega

Assesses an option's sensitivity to changes in market volatility.

##### Rho

Estimates an option's sensitivity to changes in interest rates.

Options pricing is dynamic and subject to market forces, including changes in
the underlying asset price, implied volatility, and interest rates. As a
result, option prices can fluctuate throughout the life of the option
contract.

At a meta-level, options pricing can be influenced by various mathematical
models that other traders are following, the most commonly used being the
Black-Scholes model. This model takes into account factors such as the
underlying asset price, strike price, time to expiration, volatility, risk-
free interest rate, and dividends (if applicable) to calculate the theoretical
value of the option.

## Decentralized Options Designs

On-chain options come in various types depending on how you want to handle
order matching, liquidity provisioning, and the range of options trading
preferences and strategies you want to provide users.

### Decentralized Options Vaults (DOVs)

Decentralized option vaults are a specific type of decentralized options
protocol that allows users to interact with predefined options strategies and
access pools of liquidity. These vaults automate the execution of options
strategies, providing users with predefined risk profiles and investment
opportunities.

Smart contracts underpinning the DOVs streamline the execution of options
strategies, eliminating the need for manual intervention and enhancing
operational efficiency. By interacting with DOVs, users can conveniently
access predefined options strategies that align with their risk preferences
and investment objectives, saving time and effort in crafting custom
strategies.

DOVs also provide users with the advantages of liquidity pooling. By
consolidating liquidity from various participants into these vaults, DOVs
offer enhanced liquidity and competitive pricing for options trading. This
pooling mechanism ensures that traders can execute their options transactions
efficiently, even during periods of high demand or market volatility.

### AMM-Based Options

AMM-based options trading involves utilizing the liquidity provided by AMM
pools, where the prices are determined algorithmically based on the pool's
liquidity and the options' parameters. Traders can interact with the AMM pools
to trade options by providing liquidity or executing trades against the pool's
available liquidity.

The algorithmic pricing mechanism of AMM pools considers factors such as the
pool's liquidity, the strike prices, expiration dates, and volatility to
determine fair and competitive options prices. This automated process
eliminates the need for order book matching and centralizes liquidity within
the AMM pools, simplifying the trading experience for smart contract
developers and facilitating seamless execution of options trades.

### Order Book-Based Options

The more traditional way of trading options, similar to traditional finance,
utilize order books for price discovery. These platforms provide users with
the flexibility to create and customize their own options contracts, set
strike prices, expiration dates, and other parameters. Traders can interact
with the order book to place and match buy and sell orders for options
contracts.

Within order book-based options platforms, users have the freedom to set
strike prices, choose expiration dates, define various contract parameters,
and ultimately design options contracts that suit their unique requirements.

### Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Options

Peer-to-Peer on-chain options enable direct interaction between option buyers
and sellers without an intermediary. Smart contracts facilitate the creation
and settlement of option contracts, eliminating the need for centralized order
matching. P2P options offer greater privacy and flexibility, allowing
participants to negotiate terms and conditions directly.

### Over-the-Counter (OTC) Options

OTC options are customized on-chain options tailored to specific traders'
needs, negotiated and executed directly between the parties. Smart contracts
would facilitate the creation and settlement of OTC options, providing a
decentralized and secure environment for private trading.

## Types of Options

Options encompass various types with differences in method of settlement and
freedom to exercise. Some categories are unique to on-chain trading.

American-style options can be exercised at any time before the expiration
date, providing flexibility to traders.

European-style options can only be exercised at the expiration date itself,
offering a standardized approach.

Asian-style options calculate the payoff based on the average price of the
underlying asset over a specific period. These options can be useful in
volatile markets.

Binary options are a type of on-chain option with a fixed payout determined at
the time of contract creation. The option either pays out a predefined amount
if the underlying asset meets a specific condition (e.g. above/below a certain
price) at expiration, or it expires worthless.

Perpetual options combine the features of perpetual futures contracts and
options. These options do not have an expiration date but allow traders to
exercise them at any time, offering exposure to price movements while allowing
more flexibility in timing.

Physically settled options involve the actual delivery of the underlying asset
upon exercise. If a trader exercises a physically settled call option, they
receive the underlying asset at the predetermined strike price. Similarly,
when exercising a physically settled put option, the trader delivers the
underlying asset and receives the strike price in return. Physically settled
options are particularly suitable for traders seeking direct ownership or
exposure to the underlying asset.

Cash settled options, also known as index options, do not involve the physical
delivery of the underlying asset upon exercise. Instead, the settlement is
based on the difference between the underlying asset's price and the strike
price. If the option is in-the-money at expiration, the trader receives a cash
payment representing the option's intrinsic value. Cash settled options are
commonly used when trading options on indices, where physical delivery may not
be practical or necessary.

## How Decentralized Options Use Oracles

This section outlines how on-chain options utilize oracles to access real-
world data for pricing and settling options on the blockchain.

### Pricing Options

Access to oracle prices ensures that an option's price accurately reflects the
real-time value of the underlying asset. When a user creates a new option
contract, the smart contract would fetch the current asset price from the
oracle. This price becomes the reference point for determining the option's
strike price and the potential profit or loss at expiration.

As market conditions change, the oracle continuously updates the asset price,
allowing the option contract's price to adjust accordingly. This dynamic
pricing mechanism ensures that the on-chain options remain aligned with the
rapidly changing market conditions, providing a fair, transparent trading
environment for participants.

Financial oracles like Pyth can publish a
[secure](https://pyth.network/blog/reliability-efforts-at-pyth) and [verified
price](https://pyth.network/price-feeds) resulting from an [aggregate
of](https://pyth.network/blog/pyth-price-aggregation-proposal) real-time
inputs by exchanges and liquidity pools.

### Settling Options

At option expiration, oracles play a critical role in the automatic settlement
process of on-chain options. As the expiration date approaches, the smart
contract relies on the oracle to supply the final asset price. This price
becomes the basis for determining the option's profitability and whether it is
in-the-money or out-of-the-money.

If the final asset price is favorable and the option is in-the-money, the
smart contract automatically executes the settlement, allowing the option
holder to exercise their right to buy or sell the underlying asset at the
predetermined strike price. Conversely, if the option is out-of-the-money at
expiration, the smart contract automatically cancels the option, and the
option holder does not exercise their right to buy or sell the asset.

By relying on oracles for the settlement process, on-chain options eliminate
the need for manual intervention and ensure a trustless, efficient execution
of contracts. Oracles like Pyth specialize in [low-
latency](https://pyth.network/price-feeds) prices aggregated from multiple
exchanges and liquidity venues to achieve a price output reflective of the
overall market.

Pyth is the only oracle which provides [confidence
intervals](https://pyth.network/blog/what-is-confidence), or confidence bands
around the reported price which reflect the level of price divergence and
volatility across the markets. A wider confidence band (e.g. BTC/USD at
$30,000 ± $100 instead of ± $10) indicates greater divergence or “uncertainty”
between venues. Options platforms can use this confidence data to inform their
risk management.

## Options Glossary

This glossary section defines the most common terms in the on-chain options
space.

##### At-The-Money (ATM)

Refers to an on-chain option with a strike price equal to the current market
price of the underlying asset.

##### American-Style Options

On-chain options that allow the option holder to exercise the option at any
time before or on the expiration date.

##### Binary Options

On-chain options with a fixed payout determined at contract creation,
depending on whether the predefined condition is met at expiration.

##### Call Option

An on-chain option that gives the holder the right to buy the underlying asset
at the predetermined strike price on or before the expiration date.

##### Decentralized Option Vaults (DOVs)

Automated market makers designed for on-chain options. They pool liquidity and
use smart contracts to facilitate option trading without the need for
centralized intermediaries.

##### European-Style Options

immediately. For a call option, it means the current market price is below the
strike price. For a put option, it means the current market price is above the
strike price.

##### Over-the-Counter (OTC) Options

Customized on-chain options negotiated and executed directly between two
parties outside traditional exchanges.

##### Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Options

On-chain options that enable direct interaction between option buyers and
sellers without the involvement of an intermediary.

##### Put Option

An on-chain option that gives the holder the right to sell the underlying
asset at the predetermined strike price on or before the expiration date.

##### Strike Price

The fixed price at which the option holder can buy (call option) or sell (put
option) the underlying asset when exercising the option.

## Starting with the Greeks

Options Greeks are a set of risk indicators used to measure the sensitivity of
on-chain options to various factors influencing their price and performance.
Understanding the Greeks is essential for on-chain options traders and
developers as it helps in formulating effective trading strategies and
managing risk.

### First Order

Delta: measures the sensitivity of the option price to changes in the
underlying asset's price.

Vega: measures the sensitivity of the option price to changes in implied
volatility.

Theta: quantifies the rate at which the option's time value erodes over time.

Rho: indicates the sensitivity of the option price to changes in interest
rates.

### Second Order

Gamma: represents the rate at which the delta of an option changes in response
to changes in the underlying asset's price.

Charm: measures the rate at which the delta of an option changes as the time
to expiration approaches.

Vanna: measures the sensitivity of the delta to changes in implied volatility.

Vera: measures the sensitivity of the vega to changes in implied volatility.

Veta: quantifies the rate at which the vega changes as the time to expiration
approaches.

Vomma: measures the sensitivity of vega to changes in implied volatility.

### Third Order

Color: captures the rate of change of gamma as the underlying asset's price
changes.

Speed: quantifies the rate of change of the gamma.

Ultima: measures the sensitivity of vomma to changes in implied volatility.

Zomma: quantifies the rate of change of gamma with respect to changes in
implied volatility.
