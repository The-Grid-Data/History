## Privacy Policy

The Pyth Data Association (“Pyth”) with registered office at Grabenstrasse 25,
6340 Baar, Switzerland, respects the privacy of Personal Data and is committed
to protecting Personal Data. This Data Protection and Privacy Policy (this
“Policy”) describes the policies and procedures Pyth has implemented to
protect Personal Data Processed by Pyth in accordance with applicable Data
Protection Laws.  
  
Pyth has voluntarily opted to apply the protections and obligations outlined
in this Policy to all Data Subjects. However, such protections and obligations
may be beyond the legal requirements of the jurisdiction of certain Data
Subjects. Data Protection Laws vary widely across jurisdictions and while Pyth
will strive to meet this Policy for all Data Subjects, the Data Protection
Laws for the Data Subject ultimately govern the protections conferred in the
specific jurisdiction applicable to that Data Subject, and this Policy does
not confer any rights beyond those granted by the relevant Data Protection
Laws.  
  
This Policy describes how Pyth collects and uses Personal Data, the
circumstances under which Pyth may share Personal Data, the applicable rights
of Data Subjects, and Pyth’s technical and physical safeguards to protect the
security of Personal Data.

Laws. Under the current Swiss Federal Data Protection Act Personal Data also
includes information relating to legal entities. Personal Data does not
include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data). Personal
Data shall encompass Special Category Data. Such information includes, but is
not limited to:

  * Name;
  * Addresses;
  * Telephone numbers;
  * Email addresses;
  * Government-issued identification numbers;
  * User passwords or PINs;
  * User identification and account access credentials, passwords, PINs and security question answers;
  * Financial account numbers; and
  * Geolocation data.

“Process” or “Processing” or “Processed” or “Processes” means, as applicable,
any operation or set of operations performed upon Personal Data, whether or
not by automatic means, such as collecting, recording, using, organizing,
structuring, storing, adapting or altering, retrieving, disclosing by
transmission, disseminating or otherwise making available, aligning or
combining, restricting, erasing, or purging.  
  
“Processor” means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or
other body that Processes Personal Data on behalf of a Controller, as defined
in Data Protection Laws. A Processors’ activities are limited to the more
“technical” aspects of a Process and do not include the exercise of
professional judgment or significant decision-making in relation to Personal
Data. Processors may include third-party service providers, applications, or
agencies utilized by Pyth in the course of business.  
  
“Special Category Data” means Personal Data revealing racial or ethnic origin,
criminal history, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs,
sexual orientation, trade union membership, or health, genetic, or biometric
data, or data pertaining to a child or minor.

#### A. GENERAL DATA PROTECTION INFORMATION

#### DATA PROTECTION PRINCIPLES

Pyth is committed to processing data in accordance with its responsibilities
under the Data Protection Laws, and in particular with the following
principles:

  * Fair, lawful and transparent processing;
  * Collection for a specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and no further processing in a manner that is incompatible with the specified purposes;
  * Limitation to what is adequate, relevant and necessary in relation to the purposes for which the Personal Data are processed;
  * Keep Personal Data accurate and up to date;
  * Keep Personal Data only for as long as is necessary or legally required;
  * Process Personal Data in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures;
  * Process Personal Data in accordance with the rights of the Data Subject; and
  * Ensure an adequate level of data protection when transferring Personal Data to a country outside of the European Economic Area.

#### LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL DATA

Pyth will only use Personal Data when Data Protection Laws allow Pyth to do
so. Personal Data shall be Processed in a manner that is adequate, relevant,
and not excessive in relation to the intended business purpose(s) of such
Processing. A legal basis is required to process Personal Data. Personal Data
may be processed only if at least one of the following legal bases applies:

  1. Consent: Data Subject giving consent to the Processing of his or her Personal Data for a specific purpose(s);
  2. Contractual necessity: Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the Data Subject is party or entering into a contract, such as due diligence (anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing checks); complying with applicable sanctions and embargo legislation; regulatory, governmental, tax and law enforcement authority requests; surveillance and investigation activities; carrying out audit checks, and instructing our auditors; maintaining statutory registers; and preventing and detecting fraud;
  3. Compliance with legal obligations: Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which Pyth is subject;
  4. Vital interests: Processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the Data Subject or of another natural person;
  5. Public interests: Processing is permitted if it is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest. Examples include taxation, crime reporting, public health and quality and safety of products; or
  6. Legitimate interests: Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Pyth or a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the Data Subject which require protection of Personal Data, in particular where the Data Subject is a child.

#### RIGHTS OF DATA SUBJECTS

When applicable, Pyth shall honor Data Subject rights, as described herein. In
accordance with Data Protection Laws and in certain circumstances, a Data
Subject may possess the right to:

  1. Request access to his or her Personal Data that Pyth holds to check that it is accurately and lawfully being Processed.
  2. Request correction of his or her Personal Data that Pyth holds. This enables Personnel to have any incomplete or inaccurate Personal Data be corrected, though Pyth may need to verify the accuracy of any new Personal Data provided.
  3. Request erasure of his or her Personal Data. This enables Personnel to ask Pyth to delete or remove Personal Data where there is no legitimate purpose for the Processing of such Personal Data by Pyth. Pyth may not always be able to comply with the request of erasure for specific legal reasons or other legitimate grounds, which will be notified to Personnel, if applicable, at the time of the request.
  4. Object to Processing of his or her Personal Data where Pyth is relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and he or she would like to object to the Processing because it impacts his or her fundamental rights and freedoms.
  5. Request restriction of Processing of his or her Personal Data. This enables Data Subjects to ask Pyth to suspend Processing Personal Data in the following scenarios: (i) establishing the accuracy of Personal Data; (ii) where Pyth's use of Personal Data is unlawful, but there is no request of erasure; (iii) where a Data Subject needs Pyth to hold Personal Data even if retention is no longer required and it is needed to establish, exercise, or defend a legal claim; or (iv) a Data Subject objects to Pyth's use of Personal Data, but Pyth needs to verify whether there are overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
  6. Request the transfer of his or her Personal Data. Pyth will provide to Personnel, or a third party, his or her Personal Data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. This right only applies to automated information.
  7. Withdraw consent at any time where Pyth is relying on consent to Process Personal Data. This will not affect the lawfulness of any Processing carried out before consent is withdrawn.
  8. Be notified of a data breach involving a Data Subject's Personal Data.

Pyth shall accept, when applicable, any written requests through the
appropriate channels from a Data Subject to exercise his or her rights and
freedoms pursuant to Data Protection Laws. Pyth shall use reasonable means to
verify the identity of the requester.

#### PYTH DATA PROTECTION OBLIGATIONS

Pyth and its Personnel have implemented appropriate technical and
organizational measures to provide adequate protection regarding Data
Subjects’ rights and the lawful, fair, and transparent Processing of Personal
Data, as described herein. Pyth data protection obligations include the
following:

  1. Consent: When consent is the lawful basis for Processing, Pyth shall obtain the affirmative consent of a Data Subject prior to such Processing. Consent shall be written in clear and plain language by Pyth and the Data Subject must give consent freely. Prior to providing consent, a Data Subject shall be notified by Pyth that consent may be withdrawn at any time. Consent may not be permanently binding on Data Subjects, as such Data Subjects may withdraw consent at any time.
  2. Purpose Limitation: Pyth shall restrict the Processing of Personal Data to the intended business purpose(s).
  3. Notification: Pyth shall provide notification in clear language to a Data Subject at the outset of Processing, which may include: name of Controller and contact information; purpose of Processing; type(s) of Personal Data Processed; whom has access to Personal Data; Processing location(s); retention period; Data Subject’s rights and instructions for exercising such rights; and protections against data breaches.
  4. Access: Upon request by a Data Subject, Pyth shall provide such Data Subject with access to his or her Personal Data in the possession or under the control of Pyth and information about the ways in which Personal Data may have been previously Processed.
  5. Correction: Upon request by a Data Subject, Pyth shall correct any error or omission in a Data Subject’s Personal Data in the possession or under the control of Pyth. If Personal Data is corrected, Pyth must inform (i) third-parties to whom data has been disclosed of correction and (ii) Data Subjects that his or her Personal Data has been disclosed to third-parties.
  6. Erasure: Upon request by a Data Subject, Pyth shall erase such Data Subject’s Personal Data in the possession or under the control of Pyth, if: (i) Personal Data is no longer necessary for the intended business purpose for which it was Processed; (ii) the Data Subject withdraws consent and there is no other legitimate basis for the Processing; (iii) the Data Subject objects to Processing based solely on Pyth’s legitimate interest; (iv) the Processing of Personal Data is unlawful; or (v) Personal Data is related to the offer of information society services to a child. This is not an absolute right, as Personal Data may be retained to the extent required or permitted under applicable law. If Pyth discloses Personal Data to a third-party, Pyth shall notify such third-parties of any fulfilled request to erase, unless unreasonable or would result in a disproportionate effort.
  7. Accuracy: Pyth shall make a reasonable effort to verify that Personal Data Processed by or on behalf of Pyth is accurate and complete. Generally, Personal Data is obtained directly from the Data Subject.
  8. Protection: Pyth shall protect Personal Data in its possession or under its control by securing against unauthorized Processing, as further described in the “Security Measures Taken to Protect Personal Data” Section.
  9. Retention: Personal Data will be retained for as long as is necessary for the intended purpose. Pyth shall cease to retain documentation containing Personal Data or remove the means by which Personal Data can be associated with a particular Data Subject when (i) the intended purpose for which Personal Data was Processed is no longer applicable and (ii) the retention is no longer necessary for legal or business purposes.
  10. Breach Notification: In the case of a data breach involving any loss, misuse, or alteration of Personal Data that is likely to result in (i) a risk to Data Subjects’ rights and freedoms, Pyth shall notify the supervisory or data protection authorities within seventy-two (72) hours; or (ii) a high risk to Data Subjects’ rights and freedoms, Pyth shall notify Data Subjects without undue delay.

#### SHARING OF PERSONAL DATA

Pyth has executed appropriate documentation to protect the privacy and
fundamental rights and freedoms of Data Subjects and has taken appropriate
measures to ensure data protection during the sharing of Personal Data.  
  
Pyth may share Personal Data with third-parties to Process (maintain, store,
use) on Pyth’s behalf. Pyth requires all such Processors to take appropriate
security measures to protect Personal Data in accordance with Pyth’s policies.
Pyth does not allow Processors to Process Personal Data for their own purposes
and only permits them to Process Personal Data for specified purposes and in
accordance with Pyth's instructions.  
  
Pyth may share Personal Data with third parties to Process on their own
behalf. Such third parties will be considered joint-Controllers of such
Personal Data. While joint-Controllers have shared discretion over the
purposes of Processing, all such Controllers agree to Process such shared
Personal Data in accordance with Data Protection Laws.

  1. Third-Parties: Pyth may, from time to time, engage with Processors or joint Controllers, such as third-party service providers, applications, or agencies, to Process Personal Data. Prior to the Processing of Pyth-controlled Personal Data by a Processor or joint Controller, Pyth will work with such third-parties to verify that adequate documentation and security safeguards are in place to Process Personal Data in accordance with Data Protection Laws. The Processor or joint Controller shall restrict Processing to the intended business purpose.
  2. Pyth Entities: Pyth shall not transfer Personal Data to a country or territory outside the jurisdiction in which it was Processed, except in accordance with the requirements prescribed under Data Protection Laws. Pyth may transfer or provide access to Personal Data across jurisdictions and entities in accordance with its Data Protection Agreements and Intercompany Agreements, which are aligned with Data Protection Laws.

Various third-parties are explicitly mentioned in this Policy (e.g., in
section “Tracking Tools”). The Personal Data is passed on or accessed for the
purpose of providing and maintaining the functionalities of the website.

#### TRANSFER OF PERSONAL DATA ABROAD

Pyth may transfer your Personal Data to third-parties based abroad for the
purposes of the data processing described in this Policy.  
  
Such third-parties are obliged to protect the privacy of individuals to the
same extent as Pyth does. If the level of data protection in a country does
not correspond to the Swiss or European level, Pyth contractually ensures that
the protection of your Personal Data corresponds to that in Switzerland or the
EU at all times. To this end, Pyth agrees on the EU standard contractual
clauses with the third-parties and implements additional technical and
organizational measures, if necessary.  
  
Certain third-parties mentioned in this Policy are based in the USA (see
section “Links to Our Social Media Presences” or section “Tracking Tools”).
Further explanations regarding data transfers to the USA can be found below
under section “Note on Data Transfers to the USA”.

#### NOTE ON DATA TRANSFERS TO THE USA

Some of the third-parties mentioned in this Policy are based in the USA. For
the sake of completeness, Pyth would like to point out for Data Subjects who
are resident or domiciled in Switzerland or the EU that there are surveillance
measures in place in the USA by US authorities, which generally allow the
storage of all Personal Data of all persons whose data has been transferred
from Switzerland or the EU to the USA. This is done without any
differentiation, limitation or exception based on the objective pursued and
without any objective criterion that would make it possible to limit the
access of the US authorities to the data and their subsequent use to very
specific, strictly limited purposes that are capable of justifying the
intrusion associated with both the access to and the use of this data.
Furthermore, Pyth would like to point out that in the USA, Data Subjects from
Switzerland or the EU do not have any legal remedies that allow them to obtain
access to the data concerning them and to obtain their correction or deletion,
or that there is no effective judicial legal protection against general access
rights of US authorities.  
  
Pyth would like to point out to Data Subjects who are resident in Switzerland
or a member state of the EU that the USA does not have a sufficient level of
data protection from the point of view of the European Union and Switzerland -
among other things due to the issues mentioned in this section. Insofar as
Pyth has explained in this Policy that recipients of data (such as Google) are
based in the USA, Pyth will ensure through contractual arrangements with these
companies, as well as any additional appropriate guarantees required, that
your Personal Data is protected with our partners with an appropriate level.

#### SECURITY MEASURES TAKEN TO PROTECT PERSONAL DATA

Pyth has implemented appropriate elements of privacy by design in conjunction
with technical and physical safeguards to protect the security of Personal
Data from unauthorized or unlawful Processing. Pyth uses a number of systems
and applications to protect Personal Data at all times, which also allow for
the following capabilities: (i) the anonymization and encryption of Personal
Data; (ii) the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity,
availability, and resilience of Processing Personal Data; (iii) the ability to
restore the availability and access to Personal Data in a timely manner in the
event of a physical or technical incident; and (iv) a process for regularly
testing, assessing, and evaluating, at least annually, the effectiveness of
such security measures.  
  
In assessing the appropriate level of security as well as the risks of varying
likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of Data Subjects, Pyth
assesses the risks presented by the Processing of Personal Data. Such risks
may include, but are not limited to, any accidental, unlawful, or unauthorized
destruction, loss, disclosure, alteration, or access to Personal Data
Processed by or on behalf of Pyth, or other factors that may impact Data
Subject rights and freedoms. Pyth shall make reasonable attempts to ensure
that any risks presented by the Processing of Personal Data are sufficiently
mitigated by technological and/or organizational controls, including limited
access of Personal Data utilizing access controls and password protections.

#### THIRD PARTY WEBSITES AND SOCIAL MEDIA

This website may contain content and links to third-party websites that are
not owned, operated, or controlled by Pyth. Pyth is not responsible for the
privacy practices of or the content displayed on such third-party websites.  
  
When engaging with Pyth’s content on or through a third-party social
networking website, plug-in, or application, Pyth may Process Personal Data
associated with your social media account.

#### TRACKING TOOLS

 _Google Analytics_  
  
We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Ireland
Limited, Google Building Gordon House, 4 Barrow St, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland
or Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA.
Google Analytics uses methods that enable an analysis of the use of the
website, such as cookies. These generate information about your use of the
website, such as:

  * Navigation path that a visitor follows on the website;
  * How long you spend on the website and subpages;
  * The subpage from which you leave the website;
  * The country, region or city from where you access the website;
  * End device (type, version, colour depth, resolution, width and height of the browser window);
  * Returning or new visitor;
  * Browser provider/version;
  * The operating system used;
  * The referrer URL (previously visited website);
  * Host name of the accessing computer (IP address); or
  * Time of the server request.

This information is transmitted to Google servers in the USA and stored there.
In doing so, the IP address is shortened by activating IP anonymisation on the
website before transmission within the Member States of the European Union or
in other Contracting States of the Agreement on the European Economic Area, as
well as in Switzerland. The anonymised IP address transmitted by your browser
as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with other Google data. Only in
exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server
in the USA and shortened there. In these cases, we ensure that Google complies
with a sufficient level of data protection by means of contractual guarantees,
in particular by agreeing to the EU standard contractual clauses and
additional measures.  
  
The information is used to evaluate the use of the website, to compile reports
on website activities and to provide other services associated with website
and internet use for the purposes of market research and demand-oriented
design of the website. Google may transfer this information to third parties
where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the
information on Google’s behalf. According to Google, under no circumstances
will the IP address be associated with other data relating to the user.  
  
The legal basis for processing the data for the above purposes is your
consent, which you give us by using the cookie banner. You can revoke your
consent at any time (section “Contact”).  
  
You can prevent the collection of the data generated by the cookies (including
the IP address), which relate to the use of the website, by Google as well as
the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing the
browser plugin available under the following link:
[http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de)  
  
An opt-out cookie will be stored on your device. If you delete all cookies,
the link must be clicked again.  
  
_Google Tag Manager_  
  
We use Google Tag Manager, a service of Google Ireland Limited, Google
Building, Gordon House, 4 Barrow St, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland or Google Inc.,
1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA, to manage cookies
and pixels for tracking tools and other tools. The Tag Manager tool itself is
a cookie-less domain and does not collect any Personal Data. Instead, the tool
triggers other tags that may in turn collect data. If you opt for a
deactivation at the main or cookie level, this remains in place for all
tracking tags implemented with Google Tag Manager.  
  
This processing is based on our legitimate interest. You can object to this
data processing at any time (see section “Contact”).  
  
_Cloudflare Insights_  
  
We use on the website functions from Cloudflare. The provider is Cloudflare,
Inc, 101 Townsend St, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA. Cloudflare offers a
globally distributed content delivery network with DNS. We have concluded a
corresponding data processing agreement and EU standard contractual clauses
with Cloudflare.  
  
Cloudflare creates copies of our website and places them on their own servers.
When you visit our website, you are automatically connected to Cloudflare's
nearby servers, which deliver the data. This significantly reduces the loading
time.  
  
The information processed may include, but is not limited to, IP addresses,
system configuration information and other information about traffic to and
from our websites, devices, applications and/or networks (collectively, “Log

providing the services (collectively, “Operational Metrics”). Examples of
Operational Metrics include service availability and service uptime metrics,
request volumes, error rates, cache rates and IP threat scores. Cloudflare
uses and processes End User Log Data to fulfil its obligations under our
agreement.  
  
We use Cloudflare to increase the speed of our website and at the same time
reduce latency and in this way improve/optimise the user experience. The data
processing takes place on the basis of our legitimate interest. You can object
to this data processing at any time (see section “Contact”). You can also
deactivate or block the cookies set by this service as indicated in the
section “Cookies”. Please find more information about the data processing by
Cloudflare under <https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/>.
