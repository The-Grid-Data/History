## Introduction

Slashing is a critical security mechanism within the proof-of-stake (PoS)
consensus models of blockchain technology. It serves as a disciplinary action
against validators who engage in detrimental behaviour, ensuring the integrity
and reliability of the network. Validators on a PoS blockchain are required to
stake their own cryptocurrency as collateral, aligning their interests with
the network's health. If they act maliciously or fail to meet their
responsibilities, they face slashing, which is the forfeiture of a portion of
their staked coins.

This punitive measure targets key misbehaviours such as downtime, where a
validator's node is offline and unable to participate in consensus processes,
or double-signing, where a validator might inadvertently or maliciously run
the same keys on multiple servers, creating conflicts and risks for the
network. Slashing can also be applied in cases of direct manipulation of the
consensus process, such as signing different blocks for the same slot.

The specifics of slashing vary across different blockchain protocols, but the
underlying principle remains the same: it is a powerful tool to deter bad
behaviour, maintain network security, and ensure validators act in the best
interest of the blockchain network. Understanding the nuances of slashing
rules is essential for anyone interested in PoS blockchains. As a top
validator ourselves, we decided to compile a list of slashing rules for anyone
to understand the workings of a PoS blockchain.

This repository aims to provide a list of various slashing rules, and
whitepaper links across different chains, offering valuable insights into the
mechanisms that keep blockchain networks secure and efficient. This repository
will be updated as and when necessary.

### Sui - SUI

Whitepaper: [Sui Whitepaper](https://docs.sui.io/paper/sui.pdf)

Sui's blockchain protocol introduces a distinctive system called the Tallying
Rule, aimed at ensuring network integrity through community engagement. This
rule is specifically designed to promote active monitoring among validators
within the network. Each validator is tasked with the continuous observation
and evaluation of their peers. This process is critical for confirming that
all validators are operating efficiently and aligning with the network's
overarching goals.

Under the Tallying Rule, validators generally assign a default score of one to
each other, symbolizing satisfactory performance. However, if a validator
observes improper or inefficient operations from a peer, they adjust this
score to zero. The scoring is not just a nominal exercise; it carries
significant weight. Validators who are scored low are subject to penalties,
including reduced stake rewards, which serve as a deterrent against negative
behaviours.

The global Tallying Rule score is computed at the end of each epoch, which
underscores the importance of constant vigilance by validators. They are
expected to be proactive in updating their assessments based on any
behavioural changes they detect. This mutual monitoring system is a key aspect
of Sui's approach to governance. By holding validators accountable through
this scoring mechanism, the network maintains security and reliability.

### Tron - TRX

Whitepaper: [Tron
Whitepaper](https://tron.network/static/doc/white_paper_v_2_0.pdf)

In the Tron network, an interesting approach is adopted regarding the
management of misconduct by Super Representatives (SRs), who are key
validators. Unlike many other blockchains, TRX holders – the stakeholders in
the Tron ecosystem – are not subject to slashing penalties. This means their
holdings are not at risk of being reduced as a punitive measure.

Instead, the Tron network places the power of accountability in the hands of
its community. If an SR is found to be acting against the network's interests
or engaging in misconduct, the community has the authority to initiate a
voting process. This democratic approach allows TRX holders to actively
participate in governance decisions, including the potential removal of errant
SRs, thus ensuring that validators remain aligned with the network's standards
and objectives.

Another important aspect to consider for stakeholders is the allocation of
their staking. In the Tron ecosystem, staking with a validator that is not
part of the active set might lead to the forfeiture of staking rewards. This
rule highlights the significance of choosing validators wisely and staying
aligned with the active set of validators. It serves as an incentive for
stakeholders to be vigilant and informed about their choices, ensuring optimal
participation and benefit realization within the Tron network.

### Aptos - APT

Whitepaper: [Aptos Whitepaper](https://aptos.dev/assets/files/Aptos-
Whitepaper-47099b4b907b432f81fc0effd34f3b6a.pdf)

In the Aptos blockchain network, there are no slashing mechanisms in place.
This means validators are not penalized through the deduction of their staked
tokens for issues like misconduct or downtime. Instead, the main consequence
for a node being inactive in Aptos is the loss of potential rewards, rather
than a reduction in the principal stake. This approach prioritizes active
participation from validators, without employing the harsher punitive measures
seen in some other networks.

### Archway - ARCH

Whitepaper: [Archway Whitepaper](https://archway.io/assets/archway-
whitepaper.pdf)

In Archway, which follows the Cosmos SDK framework, slashing rules are
specifically designed to maintain validator accountability and network
security. The system addresses two primary types of infractions: non-malicious
protocol faults and liveness faults.

Non-malicious protocol faults typically result from issues like
misconfigurations or update errors. Validators found responsible for such
faults face slashing of their funds, but only for their first offence. Any
further infractions lead to a state known as "tombstoning." Validators in this
state must serve a jail period before rejoining the network, and they are
penalized for the most severe infraction committed during this time.

Liveness faults occur when validators fail to verify a block. Unlike non-
malicious protocol faults, there is no cap on penalties for liveness faults.
They are immediately addressed, with the offending validators quickly put in
jail. This prevents them from committing multiple liveness faults in
succession, ensuring network reliability.

### Avalanche - AVAX

Whitepaper: [Avalanche Whitepaper](https://assets.website-
files.com/5d80307810123f5ffbb34d6e/6008d7bbf8b10d1eb01e7e16_Avalanche%20Platform%20Whitepaper.pdf)

Avalanche's unique approach to validator management does not involve any
slashing mechanisms. If a validator node behaves incorrectly, such as giving
wrong responses or failing to respond, its staked amount is fully returned
without any rewards. The network remains secure and robust as long as a
significant amount of AVAX is staked by nodes that are operating correctly,
which helps ensure the smooth processing of transactions.

In Avalanche's primary subnet, there's no slashing at all. Nodes engaging in
malicious activities don't face a cut in their stakes. Instead, their penalty
is the forfeiture of potential rewards. However, it's important to note that
future subnets within Avalanche may have the option to implement their own
forms of slashing penalties. This flexibility allows each subnet to tailor its
security measures according to its specific needs.

### Cardano - ADA

Whitepaper: [Cardano Whitepaper](https://whitepaper.io/document/581/cardano-
whitepaper)

In the Cardano network, the protocol does not enforce slashing, meaning ADA
holdings are not reduced for dishonest actions. Honesty is encouraged by the
chance to earn additional ADA. Cardano's Ouroboros mechanism counters the
"nothing at stake" issue by rewarding block producers more when they
contribute to the main chain. As Stake Pool Operators (SPOs) collectively
produce more blocks in an epoch, they share increased rewards, motivating them
to focus on the primary chain and deterring the creation of forks.

Furthermore, SPOs are motivated to pledge more ADA, with higher pledges
leading to potentially greater rewards. This pledge is locked, creating a
financial risk for SPOs in case of actions that harm consensus or the ADA
price. Delegators are advised to choose pools with higher pledges, as these
operators have a greater financial commitment. The importance of pledge may
grow in future updates, making it a key factor for delegators in their staking
decisions.

### Ethereum - ETH

Whitepaper: [Ethereum Whitepaper](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/)

Ethereum has a detailed approach when it comes to slashing, ensuring network
integrity through a well-defined set of penalties for validators who engage in
misconduct. The process begins with a whistleblower, and another validator,
identifying and reporting the misbehavior. This report is then included in a
block by a block proposer, who receives a small portion of the offender's
balance as a reward, reflecting the ethos that this act is more about network
safety than personal profit.

The penalties for the offending validator are multifaceted. Initially, they
are scheduled for an irreversible exit from the network after a predetermined
period, such as 36 days. During this period, they incur penalties starting
from the moment their infraction is included in a block. These penalties
continue for every epoch they miss their duties. Furthermore, a significant
correlation penalty is imposed, which is dependent on the number of validators
slashed during the same timeframe. This can be particularly punitive in cases
of coordinated malicious activities, potentially resulting in the loss of the
entire staked balance.

Once slashed, validators are permanently removed from the validator set. To
rejoin, they must use new validator keys and place new stakes. The slashing
process leads to a gradual depletion of the staked ETH, culminating in a
substantial loss at the midpoint of the exit period, after which the validator
can withdraw any remaining stake. This comprehensive approach underlines
Ethereum's commitment to maintaining a secure and trustworthy network.

### Polkadot - DOT

Whitepaper: [Polkadot Whitepaper](https://assets.polkadot.network/Polkadot-
whitepaper.pdf)

Polkadot's slashing mechanism is activated when 10% of validators are offline,
demonstrating the network's resilience to minor disruptions. The penalties
incurred are shared equally between the validator and their nominators,
meaning both parties face the same percentage reduction in their stake.

Upon a violation, validators enter a phase called 'unapplied slash', lasting
28 days for Polkadot and 7 days for Kusama. This period coincides with the
unbonding time, preventing stakeholders from withdrawing their stake to evade
penalties. During this phase, there's a window for governance to intervene and
potentially annul the penalty, particularly in cases where the offence was
unintentional or due to factors beyond the validator's control.

Validators guilty of slashable offences are 'chilled', meaning they are
removed from the active set and barred from the next election round. If a
penalty is applied, all their nominations are also removed, and this action is
irreversible, even if the slashing decision is later overturned by governance.

In terms of penalty distribution, slashed DOT is allocated to the Treasury.
This aids in governance decisions and supports various initiatives. The
specific allocation depends on the nature of the offence: all DOT from
liveliness offences goes to the Treasury, while for equivocation or double-
signing, a portion is given to the reporting validator. The impact of slashing
is proportionally greater on validators with larger stakes due to the
percentage-based penalty system.

### Polygon - MATIC

Whitepaper: [Polygon Whitepaper](https://polygon.technology/papers/pol-
whitepaper)

Currently, the MATIC token staking process does not include slashing. The
network aims for an annual inflation rate of 13.09%, which indicates the
planned change in token supply annually. Polygon has allocated 1.2 billion
MATIC tokens as incentives for staking over the first five years, as part of
its strategy to encourage network participation and security.

### Solana - SOL

Whitepaper: [Solana Whitepaper](https://solana.com/solana-whitepaper.pdf)

Solana's slashing policy is designed to strongly deter malicious behaviour
while protecting honest validators. The network enforces a 100% penalty for
nodes that violate safety rules, whereas validators engaged in regular
operations face no penalty. Solana's system involves gathering evidence and
conducting a thorough assessment before applying penalties, rather than
imposing automatic slashing.

In cases of safety violations during consensus, Solana's network halts to
allow for data analysis and identification of responsible parties. Slashing
proposals are considered only after the network resumes. For violations
related to optimistic confirmation, the network may not halt immediately.
Instead, stakes involved are frozen until the next network upgrade, when a
decision on slashing is made.

Solana also plans to implement a feature where transactions can recover a part
of the slashing collateral in case of proven optimistic safety violations,
acting as a form of insurance and balancing protection for validators against
penalties for wrongdoing. This strategy aims to encourage active and honest
participation in the network.

### Arcana - XAR

Whitepaper: [Arcana Whitepaper](https://arcananetwork.notion.site/Arcana-Auth-
Technical-Paper-v1-0-3-1f82dc4d69114e52a1a1a7b64b382c8d)

Currently, Arcana is in the process of revising its slashing policies. At this
moment, there isn't a definitive policy in place for slashing within the
Arcana network. This indicates an ongoing effort to develop and refine the
rules and procedures related to penalizing nodes within the network.

### Canto - CANTO

Whitepaper: [Canto Whitepaper](https://docs.canto.io/)

Canto's slashing policy, influenced by the Cosmos SDK, aims to penalize
validators for specific infractions in a fair manner. If a validator misses
signing 3000 consecutive blocks, they face a penalty of 0.75% stake reduction
and a temporary suspension of 30 minutes, known as jail time. More severe
infractions, like double signing or conflicting block votes, trigger consensus
slashing. This results in a 10% reduction in stake and permanent exclusion
from the validator set.

The policy's stringency is adjusted based on the nature of the violation and
the overall stake in the network. To prevent excessive penalties, validators
are afforded certain protections like grace periods, defined slashing
thresholds, and a maximum penalty cap of 10%. The overarching goal of this
policy is to balance the need for network security with fairness, penalizing
harmful actions while minimizing the risk of unjustified slashing.

### Chiliz - CHZ

Whitepaper: [Chiliz Whitepaper](https://whitepaper.io/document/522/chiliz-
whitepaper)

In the Chiliz network, a meticulous approach is taken to ensure the security
and reliability of the Chiliz Chain through the implementation of a slashing
policy. Validators within the Chiliz ecosystem may face slashing penalties for
specific offences, such as the production of invalid blocks, failure to
participate in consensus (e.g., not signing or voting on blocks), or double-
signing blocks. The severity of the violation determines the extent of stake
slashing, with penalties varying based on the nature of the misconduct.

Building upon the baseline of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility,
the Chiliz Chain introduces a robust system of 11 validators utilizing the
Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA) consensus. The Chiliz Chain incorporates
sophisticated double-sign detection and other slashing logic, reinforcing the
network's commitment to security, stability, and chain finality. This multi-
layered approach ensures that the Chiliz Chain remains resilient, fostering a
secure and reliable environment for participants in the Chiliz ecosystem.
Stakers and validators alike are incentivised to uphold the integrity of the
network through adherence to stringent security measures.

### Cosmos - ATOM

Whitepaper: [Cosmos Whitepaper](https://cosmos.network/about/whitepaper)

The Cosmos network takes a unique approach to blockchain interoperability,
allowing independent blockchains to seamlessly communicate and share
information. In Cosmos, slashing rules are specifically designed to maintain
validator accountability and network security. The system addresses two
primary types of infractions: non-malicious protocol faults and liveness
faults.

Non-malicious protocol faults typically result from issues like
misconfigurations or update errors. Validators found responsible for such
faults face slashing of their funds, but only for their first offence. Any
further infractions lead to a state known as "tombstoning." Validators in this
state must serve a jail period before rejoining the network, and they are
penalized for the most severe infraction committed during this time.

Liveness faults occur when validators fail to verify a block. Unlike non-
malicious protocol faults, there is no cap on penalties for liveness faults.
They are immediately addressed, with the offending validators quickly put in
jail. This prevents them from committing multiple liveness faults in
succession, ensuring network reliability.

### Kroma - KRM

Documentation: [Kroma Network User Guide](https://docs.kroma.network/user-
guide/cofigure-your-wallet)

In the Kroma network, a distinctive approach is taken to validator
responsibilities and penalties. Unlike some other networks, double-signing is
not a concern for Kroma validators, as only the proposer bears the
responsibility for block generation, and the network currently operates with a
single proposer.

However, it's important to note that penalties may still be applicable in
alternative scenarios. For instance, submitting an invalid checkpoint output
could trigger penalties. If a submitted checkpoint output is deemed invalid,
other validators have the authority to challenge it. In the event of a
successful challenge, the bonded ETH of the offending validator will be
subject to slashing, with the slashed amount transferred to the challenging
validator.

This nuanced system in Kroma ensures that validators are held accountable for
specific actions, even as the network's design minimizes concerns related to
double-signing. The approach reflects Kroma’s commitment to maintaining
integrity and security while adapting to the unique aspects of its consensus
mechanism and validator roles.

### Near - NEAR

Whitepaper: [NEAR White Paper](https://near.org/papers/the-official-near-
white-paper)

Within the NEAR network, a resilient security model is implemented to deter
manipulation attempts on the chain. Manipulating the NEAR chain would
necessitate gaining control over the majority of validators simultaneously,
ensuring that malicious activity remains undetected. However, this ambitious
endeavour comes with a significant deterrent—the requirement to put a
substantial sum of capital at risk.

The security architecture of NEAR introduces a powerful economic disincentive,
as an unsuccessful attempt to manipulate the chain would result in the
slashing of staked tokens. This penalty mechanism aligns with NEAR's
commitment to maintaining the network's integrity and security. The
substantial financial risk associated with such manipulation attempts serves
as a formidable barrier, emphasizing NEAR's proactive approach to security
measures and ensuring the protection of the network and its stakeholders.

### Kusama - KSM

Whitepaper: [Kusama Whitepaper](https://guide.kusama.network/docs/kusama-
claims/)

Kusama, known as Polkadot's canary network, is designed for experimental
development, which explains its similar slashing methodology to Polkadot,
enabling the testing and fine-tuning of these protocols. Kusama takes a
proactive stance against misbehaviour, employing slashing as a penalization
mechanism for instances such as network attacks or the operation of modified
software by validators. The consequences extend to both validators and
nominators, resulting in losses of bonded KSM.

Crucially, the slashed KSM doesn't vanish; instead, it enters the Treasury,
contributing to the network's collective resources. The potential for reversal
exists through governance proposals within a specific 7-day window, adding a
layer of community-driven oversight.

The severity of slashing within Kusama is tiered across four offense levels,
addressing a spectrum of misbehaviors. Ranging from minor penalties to
significant consequences for severe threats, this structured approach
emphasizes the network's commitment to maintaining a secure and resilient
environment. Notably, slashing is applied to active nominations, treating each
validator independently. This nuanced system underscores Kusama's dedication
to robust security measures while providing mechanisms for community-driven
governance and redemption.

### Stride - STRD

Whitepaper: [Stride Whitepaper](https://docs.stride.zone/docs)

Within the Stride network, a robust slashing policy is implemented based on
two fundamental principles: Double signing and Downtime. These principles form
the cornerstone of Stride's commitment to maintaining the security and
reliability of its network.

Double signing is considered a severe offence within Stride, occurring when a
validator signs two blocks at the same height. Such an action poses a
significant threat to the network's security. In response to double signing,
Stride employs a tiered slashing mechanism:

  * First Offense: 10% slash

  * Second Offense: 20% slash

  * Third Offense: 30% slash

  * Fourth Offense: 50% slash

  * Fifth Offense: Removal from the validator set

Downtime, defined as a validator being offline for a specified period, is also
addressed in Stride's slashing policy. Recognizing the potential harm to the
network when validators are offline, Stride applies the following slashing
structure for downtime:

  * More than 1 hour of downtime: 1% slash

  * More than 6 hours of downtime: 2% slash

  * More than 12 hours of downtime: 3% slash

  * More than 24 hours of downtime: 5% slash

Validators found in violation of either of these principles face slashing, a
process that reduces the amount of staked tokens held by the validator. This
not only results in a loss of rewards for the offending validator but also
introduces challenges in maintaining its position within the validator set.
Stride's meticulously crafted slashing policy underscores its commitment to a
secure and resilient network, fostering an environment where validators are
held accountable for their actions.

### Celestia - TIA

Whitepaper: [Celestia Resource](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09274) [Celestia
Resource](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09044) [Celestia
Resource](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10117245/)

Celestia, operating on the Cosmos SDK and leveraging the x/slashing module,
implements a slashing mechanism affecting both validators and their
delegators. If a validator undergoes slashing, delegators linked to that
validator share the same percentage reduction in their delegated funds.

For downtime, if a validator is offline for over 25% of the last 5,000 blocks,
they face a 1-minute jail period. During this time, the validator is
temporarily removed from the set, unable to propose blocks or earn rewards.
Post-jail, an unjail request is necessary for rejoining.

In the case of double signing, a more serious offense, validators lose 2% of
their stake, and the remaining amount is returned. Permanently removed from
the set, they cannot unjail. Delegators connected to the penalized validator
enter a 21-day unbonding period, free to delegate to another validator
afterward.

_Update: 01/03/2024_

### Avail - AVL

Whitepaper: [Reference Document](https://github.com/availproject/data-
availability/blob/master/reference%20document/Data%20Availability%20-%20Reference%20Document.pdf)

In the event of a validator becoming unresponsive for an entire session, they
undergo involuntary chilling, preventing them from being selected in the next
election cycle. Nonetheless, affected validators can indicate their intent to
validate again at any time. If less than 10% of nodes become unresponsive,
there is no penalty for such downtime.

Slashing may result from involuntary chilling or other infractions, leading to
a validator's loss of nominations and potential support. Consequently, even
after declaring an intent to validate before session 5, reinstatement into the
active set may be hindered by insufficient nominations. Nominators can
renominate a slashed validator via an option in the Avail Apps under "Account
Actions".

Conditions for slashing include equivocation—producing two blocks in the same
slot, or in GRANDPA terms, sending conflicting pre-vote or pre-commit messages
in the same round, affecting both validators and nominators. Additionally, if
more than 10% of validators go offline simultaneously after being chilled in
an epoch, all will be slashed. The slashing is immediately visible in Avail
Apps, but the actual financial penalty occurs later, allowing for governance
proposals to potentially reverse the decision.
