# üèÅWhat is PIP?

Shaping the future of payments

PIP is the payment layer of Web3 that provides innovative solutions for the
growing ecosystem of crypto, with a focus on micropayments. PIP's
infrastructure is designed to make it easy for people to use crypto in their
daily lives.

Funded by top-tier companies like Coinbase, Galaxy Digital, and CMS and
incubated by Binance Labs, Launched in February 2022, PIP currently offers
four payment services: Social payments, Web3 identity, Payment Button, and
Payment links.

All of PIP's products are built on cryptocurrency's open and permissionless
nature, allowing anyone to send and receive money globally without
limitations.

**Social Payments:** PIP Browser extension allows for payments on social
networks such as Twitter, Reddit, Twitch, Discord, and Github, as well as
anywhere on the internet through PIP Tags. The PIP Tag system utilizes a user-
friendly version of a cryptocurrency address, which can be used to replace the
long wallet address when sending and receiving funds on any website or social
media platform. This makes it easy for users to send and receive payments on
these platforms without having to deal with long and complex addresses.

**No-code payment button:** The simple and easy-to-use crypto payment button
can be created and embedded into any website in less than a minute. This
allows for easy integration of crypto payments into any website or online
store. The Pay button is designed to be user-friendly, making it easy for
anyone to accept cryptocurrency payments on their website.

**Web3 Identity:**[PIP.ME](http://pip.me/) is a customizable link in bio,
designed for crypto payments. This allows users to create a simple and easy-
to-use link that they can share on social media platforms. This link can then
be used to receive payments in a variety of cryptocurrencies. This feature is
particularly useful for influencers and content creators who want to monetize
their work.

**Payment Links:** Payment links allow users to send payments through any form
of communication, such as email or text messages. This feature allows for easy
and convenient payments between users, regardless of location. Payment Links
are particularly useful for businesses that want to provide a seamless payment
experience for their customers.

**Invoice:** PIP Invoice offers a simple and secure way to issue a crypto-
supported invoice. With this product, anyone can create an invoice and share
it via E-mail, messengers, or even a simple URL for personal or business
purposes. It also provides a dashboard that enables invoice issuers to manage
all invoices and check the detail with a few clicks.

**Checkout:** Launch your online store effortlessly with just a few clicks.
Simply connect your wallet, customize your store, add your products, and
you'll be up and running in no time. No need for a domain or website. Simply
share your product or store URL to start selling anywhere online.

Overall, PIP's mission is to make cryptocurrency payments as easy and
convenient as possible for anyone on the internet. We aim to bridge the gap
between the traditional web (Web2) and the decentralized web (Web3) by
providing user-friendly products that allow anyone to send, receive, and earn
digital currencies on popular websites and platforms.
