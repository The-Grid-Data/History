DeFi Land is a unique, multi-chain agriculture-simulation game created to
gamify all aspects of decentralized finance. The main goal of the game is to
make it easier and simpler for individuals to take part in the exciting world
of DeFi and crypto, while also having the opportunity to have fun.

DeFi Land offers all the features that traditional platforms have, but
everything is gathered in one place. The game offers players the opportunity
to start playing for free, grind their way up to the Play and Earn tier (or
simply purchase a Gen-0 NFT), compete with other players, craft, trade, and
dive into DeFi in a fun and exciting way.

The native utility token is called [DFL](/dfl-token/defi-land-token-dfl), and
it can be used for:

  * Trading in-game assets and NFTs

  * Staking and LP incentives

  * Game mechanics

  * Governance votes, giving players the opportunity to determine how the network resources are allocated

The Play and Earn model introduced by DeFi Land allows users to earn income
for completing tasks or reaching certain milestones. The game has something
for everyone - whether you are looking for something laid-back and fun or
something active and exciting, you can find it on DeFi Land.

DeFi Land is truly a community-led project. The main aim of our project is to
support the whole crypto and DeFi community and help the market grow and
develop further over the next few years. Through our years of building, we are
the best starting place for newcomers and the most secure sanctuary for crypto
veterans who power through every market cycle. We aim to provide opportunity
to players and our partners, ensuring that if DeFi Land grows and becomes
successful, so will the whole ecosystem.
