# Helium IoT Network Token

![](/img/blockchain/iot_header.png)

IOT is the protocol token of the [Helium IoT Network](/iot/lorawan-on-helium).
IOT was introduced to the Helium Network through the community proposal
[HIP-52](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0052-iot-dao.md) and is
further defined in subsequent HIPs(1,2). The first IOT tokens were minted
following the Solana migration on April 18, 2023.

The IOT token is mined by LoRaWAN Hotspots through both data transfer proceeds
as well as Proof of Coverage.

The mint address for IOT is
[`iotEVVZLEywoTn1QdwNPddxPWszn3zFhEot3MfL9fns`](https://explorer.solana.com/address/iotEVVZLEywoTn1QdwNPddxPWszn3zFhEot3MfL9fns)
on the Solana blockchain.

Network tokens.

## Redemption for HNT​

Protocol tokens like IOT will always be backed by HNT and will convert to HNT.
To enable this, each network within the Helium Network is allocated a pool of
HNT based on the Network Utility Score. The redemption ratio is set
algorithmically by the treasury swap contacts based on this Network Utility
Score.

The [Helium Wallet App](/wallets/helium-wallet-app) serves as the primary
platform for exchanging IOT to HNT. This transaction can also be performed
directly through the Solana blockchain using the open-source tooling found in
the [Helium GitHub repositories](https://github.com/helium).

## Token Allocation​

IOT follows a similar minting schedule to HNT, however at a max supply of
200,000,000,000 (200B).

Year 1 for IOT started on August 1st, 2022.

The issuance is scheduled to have halvings every 2 years, aligning with HNT
issuance halvings.

The emissions schedule was created in
[HIP-52](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0052-iot-dao.md#emissions-
curve) and confirmed in
[HIP-77](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0077-solana-
parameters.md#emission-schedules) and is as follows:

Year| IOT at Year Start| IOT Minted| Proof of Coverage (3)| Data Transfer (3)|
Oracles (4)| Operations Fund| veHNT Stakes  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
1| 5B| 65B| 30%| 50%| 7%| 7%| 6%  
2| 70B| 32.5B| 28.5%| 51.5%| 7%| 7%| 6%  
3| 102.5B| 32.5B| 27%| 53%| 7%| 7%| 6%  
4| 135B| 16.25B| 25.5%| 54.5%| 7%| 7%| 6%  
5| 151.25B| 16.25B| 24%| 56%| 7%| 7%| 6%  
6| 167.5B| 8.125B| 22.5%| 57.5%| 7%| 7%| 6%  
7| 175.625B| 8.125B| 21%| 59%| 7%| 7%| 6%
