transmitters, qualified custodians, and chartered banks.

# Is it possible to integrate Sphere with my existing payment solution?

Yes. You can use your own Stripe or other payment providers, and use Sphere to
add support for alternative payments and back-office automation through our
API/SDK. We designed our API to use similar data flows and object models to
reduce the amount of infrastructure to rewrite.
