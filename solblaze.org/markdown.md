### BlazeStake

We have launched an innovative liquid staking pool that allows you to
participate in a DAO-based treasury to support Solana ecosystem projects, join
airdrops, or use your liquid tokens in DeFi applications.  
  
[stake.solblaze.org](//stake.solblaze.org/)

__  

### BlazeRewards

We developed the first-ever global rewards program for SOL liquid staking and
DeFi adoption on Solana. To gain rewards, simply stake SOL with BlazeStake
and/or use bSOL in the Solana DeFi ecosystem.  
  
[rewards.solblaze.org](//rewards.solblaze.org/)

__  

### SOL Faucet

We built the first-ever mainnet Solana faucet, which allows you to claim daily
and play free games to receive some Solana. The faucet is especially useful in
emergencies in case you accidentally stake your entire balance.  
  
[solfaucet.togatech.org](//solfaucet.togatech.org/)

__  

### Status

We created the first-ever Solana RPC status page, which tracks the uptime of
several RPC providers across the Solana ecosystem, including Triton One,
GenesysGo, QuickNode, Ankr, and Blockdaemon.  
  
[status.solblaze.org](//status.solblaze.org/)

__  

### Token Minter

We set up a simple token minter project to allow you easily mint your own SPL
token on Solana. The minting tool uploads metadata to Metaplex and provides a
variety of customization features for you.  
  
[mint.solblaze.org](//mint.solblaze.org/)

__  

### SOL Pay SDK

We created the first-ever fully non-custodial Solana payments front-end
JavaScript SDK, allowing developers to quickly and easily integrate Solana
payments into their apps. Transactions go directly from users to developers.
