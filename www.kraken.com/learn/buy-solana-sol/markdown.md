### Crypto Asset General Risks



  * Investing in crypto assets is risky and each token can have its own set of risks. Below is a list of risks that generally apply to all crypto assets:
  * Volatility: The performance of crypto assets can be highly volatile, with their value dropping as quickly as it can rise. You should be prepared to lose all the money you invest in crypto assets.
  * Lack of protections: Crypto asset investments are unregulated and neither the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) nor the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) will assist or protect you in the event something goes wrong with your crypto asset investments.
  * Liquidity: Some crypto asset markets may suffer for low liquidity which could prevent you buying or selling your crypto assets at the price you want or expect.
  * Complexity: Specific crypto assets may carry with them specific complex risks that are hard to understand. Do your own research and if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

Don’t put all your eggs in one basket: Putting all your money into a single
type of investment is risky. Spreading your money across different investments
makes you less dependent on any one to do well.
