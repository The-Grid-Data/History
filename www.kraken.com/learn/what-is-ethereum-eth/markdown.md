# What is Ethereum? (ETH)

## The Beginner’s Guide to ETH

* * *

Ethereum is a leading public blockchain network that introduced smart
contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and other decentralized
solutions to the cryptocurrency industry.

  * Check the [Ethereum price](/prices/ethereum) page for more details on the current ETH value, trends, and price history.

The Ethereum network's native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), serves as the
primary[ cryptocurrency](/learn/what-is-cryptocurrency) for powering
applications built on top of its blockchain.

Ether is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, behind[
bitcoin (BTC)](/prices/bitcoin). While many people often compare Ethereum and
Bitcoin, the two are significantly different implementations of blockchain
technology.

Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum is not just for preserving or transferring value. Its
blockchain provides powerful tools for developers to create and deploy their
own interoperable, decentralized assets and services. A core concept behind
Ethereum and its various applications is that there are no central authorities
to enforce the network. This fact means the network users themselves control
decisions made for the group.

The creator of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, once
[described](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fi0ORZR4A88) Bitcoin as a pocket
calculator and Ethereum as a smartphone. Bitcoin's design means it can perform
a single function very well — transferring value. Ethereum developers, on the
other hand, can create complex applications with nearly endless capabilities.

![eth](https://assets.kraken.com/marketing/web/icons/sym-eth.svg)

* * *

### Who created Ethereum?

Vitalik Buterin is a Canadian computer programmer born in Moscow, Russia. He
is credited with co-founding an early online publication called Bitcoin
Magazine in 2011. He created Ethereum in 2013, when he was just nineteen years
old.

Buterin later received a Thiel Fellowship to pursue Ethereum full time, and
set to work creating a non-profit to help launch the project. The organization
became known as the Ethereum Foundation. The Ethereum Foundation team also
developed a global community of blockchain leaders, adopters, innovators,
developers, and businesses known as the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. The
alliance is focused on addressing global business needs by using Ethereum's
underlying technology.

In early 2014, the Ethereum Foundation sold 72 million ETH in an online crowd
sale, which generated roughly $18 million in funding.



###

## How does Ethereum work?

* * *

There are several key components to the Ethereum network.

### **Ethereum blockchain**

First, there is the Ethereum blockchain — the backbone of the Ethereum
network. The Ethereum blockchain is responsible for storing and recording all
transaction and smart contract data, known as the "state."

Following a major upgrade in September 2022 called "The Merge," Ethereum's
blockchain transitioned from a proof-of-work blockchain to a proof-of-stake
consensus mechanism. The change, formerly called Ethereum 2.0, allowed the
project to dramatically improve its overall energy consumption. The transition
to a proof-of-stake algorithm also lays the technical foundations for future
scalability improvements that should help to increase Ethereum's transaction
throughput.

### **Nodes**

A distributed network of computers, called nodes, power the Ethereum
blockchain. Nodes act as the main source of computing power for the Ethereum
blockchain. Rather than relying on a single server for the computational power
needed for the entire network, Ethereum relies on a distributed network of
nodes. Nodes run client software (software needed to interact with the
blockchain) and perform a variety of important roles.

These roles include storing and maintaining a complete transaction history of
all ETH transactions. Nodes also help to verify the state of new transaction
and smart contract data.

Anyone with sufficient computing resources and an internet connection can run
their own Ethereum node. To date, there are more than[ 6.1 million Ethereum
nodes](https://etherscan.io/nodetracker/nodes?p=200) across the globe. Nodes
play an important role in securing the consensus layer and execution layer of
the Ethereum blockchain.

The higher the number of nodes, the harder it becomes to gain control over a
51% majority of the network. This type of attack can allow a person, or a
group of people, to block incoming transactions, manipulate transaction
ordering, and process double-spend transactions.

Each validator node (also known as a staker) must lock away an amount of ETH
to participate in the transaction verification. As of Sept. 22, 2022, Ethereum
verifies transactions using the proof-of-stake consensus algorithm. The larger
the network, the greater the amount of staked assets and the more expensive it
becomes to gain majority control over the blockchain.

The network also uses an automated penalty system called "slashing" to prevent
malicious activity on the network. If a node breaks the hard-coded rules of
the protocol, the network can fully or partially confiscate a person's staked
assets without warning.

### **Ethereum virtual machine (EVM)**

The Ethereum blockchain isn't just a record of ether transactions. It must
also store smart contract data and record new changes made once those
contracts are executed. These phases are called "states."

Each time a new block is added, Ethereum's state changes. This term is why
Ethereum's blockchain is known as a "world state machine."

A program known as the Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) runs on top of the
Ethereum blockchain. The EVM reads and executes all smart contracts. All nodes
run the EVM program to make sure smart contracts follow the rules of the
protocol.

Smart contracts on Ethereum are predominantly written in a programming
language called Solidity. Vyper is another popular language used on the
Ethereum network.

Humans can write and understand these programming languages, but the EVM
cannot. It must compile the human smart contract programming language into a
machine language called EVM bytecode.

Bytecode is broken down into one of 140 opcodes. Each opcode represents a
specific function that the EVM can perform. The Ethereum virtual machine is
"Turing-complete" because it can essentially perform any type of task by
running combinations of these opcodes.

### **Ethereum's Co-Founders**

Originally, there were eight Ethereum co-founders, including Buterin. However,
over time, all but Buterin left to pursue other interests.

  * **Gavin Wood** – Author of the [Ethereum yellow paper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf), creator of Polkadot and Kusama, and developer of the Solidity programming language.
  * **Jeff Wilke** – Creator of the first Ethereum software implementation.
  * **Joseph Lubin** – Founder of Consensys, a major ethereum investment incubator.
  * **Charles Hoskinson** \- CEO and co-founder of Input Output Global (IOG).
  * **Mihai Alisie** \- Former Vice President of the Ethereum Foundation, creator of Akasha, and co-founder of Bitcoin Magazine.
  * **Anthony Di Iorio** \- Founder of Decentral and Jaxx crypto wallet.
  * **Amir Chetrit** \- Colored Coin project contributor.

### **What is ETH?**

The main [cryptocurrency](/learn/what-is-cryptocurrency) powering Ethereum is
called ether or ETH.

ETH is used to power smart contracts and transactions on the decentralized
network. Ether is currently the world's second largest cryptocurrency by
market capitalization (market cap).

Ether can be bought and sold on cryptocurrency exchanges and is used by many
as a store of value, similar to Bitcoin.

Ethereum blockchain users must pay network fees, known as gas fees, to
complete their actions and validate transactions. Ethereum denominates these
fees in ETH.

Ether's issuance fluctuates based on the total amount of ETH staked. ETH is
also burned on every transaction, causing the supply to be elastic. As
Ethereum is used more, more ETH is burned.

This elastic supply of ETH was introduced through EIP-1559. ETH started with
an initial supply of 72 million at initial launch. 80% of the initial supply
was sold to the public and 12 million were held in reserves for the Ethereum
Foundation. Ethereum has no maximum supply and the circulating supply as of
April 2023 is ~120.5 million.

![eth](https://assets.kraken.com/marketing/web/icons/sym-eth.svg)

## Why does ETH cryptocurrency have value?

First, ETH is the native token of Ethereum and powers all activities within
the blockchain. To transact value or interact with[ decentralized
applications](https://dappradar.com/rankings/protocol/ethereum/158) built on
Ethereum, users must pay a[ gas fee](/learn/what-is-a-blockchain-gas-fee)
denominated in ETH. This fee covers the node's computational costs, which are
required to process different transactions. The more complex the function and
the greater the network usage, the higher the gas prices may be. These fees
serve as transaction costs by blockchain users to network validators. Users
pay gas fees for interacting with a variety of decentralized applications,
such as decentralized exchanges like[ Uniswap](/prices/uniswap),[
Curve](/prices/curve), and[ Balancer](/prices/balancer).

Secondly, some may attribute value to ETH because of its inherent qualities.
These include being a decentralized, pseudonymous, censorship-resistant form
of digital currency that anyone in the world can own.

Finally, the market forces of supply and demand determine the value of Ether.
Across dozens of crypto exchanges, investors are constantly judging the
potential of Ethereum as a next generation cloud computing and smart contract
platform.

## What can you do with Ethereum?

With Ethereum, you can create a range of interoperable utility tokens and
decentralized applications.

These applications can provide many of the same services traditional
institutions offer, but without the need for any human middlemen to determine
the outcome of financial agreements. Smart contracts power these innovative
applications, and have led to the creation of the decentralized finance (DeFi)
sector.

Ether can also serve as a medium of exchange to transfer value and perform
financial transactions without central authorities. Because of its[ potential
to become a deflationary digital
asset](https://blog.kraken.com/post/15411/ethereum-2-0-does-eth-become-
deflationary-post-merge/), many may see ETH as a potential store of value.
However, ETH is most commonly used to pay for transaction fees on the Ethereum
mainnet.

[Non-fungible tokens (NFTs)](/learn/what-are-non-fungible-tokens-nft) are the
latest application of blockchain technology to take off on the Ethereum
blockchain. NFTs are innovative types of crypto tokens that allow individuals
to prove ownership over digital items without the need for a third-party
intermediary. These digital items can be anything from concept artwork, to
music files and gaming assets.

Some of the most popular NFT collections on Ethereum today include[
CryptoPunks](/learn/what-are-cryptopunks),[ Bored Ape Yacht Club](/learn/what-
is-bored-ape-yacht-club), and[ Doodles](/learn/what-are-doodles-nft) to name a
few.
