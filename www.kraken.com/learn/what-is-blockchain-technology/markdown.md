# What is blockchain technology?

## The beginner's guide to blockchain

Blockchain technology is a term you’ll often see used in conjunction with
Bitcoin and the wider [cryptocurrency](/en-gb/learn/what-is-cryptocurrency)
industry.

And while this new financial frontier has certainly helped popularize
blockchains, core elements of the technology actually date back as far as
[1979](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/0-387-34805-0_21.pdf) –
long before the arrival of digital assets.

## What is a blockchain?

* * *

A blockchain is a special type of online database system that distributes the
process of storing data across a network of computers connected to the
internet.

Each computer stays in constant communication with others in the network,
making tampering with information stored within their database or ledger
nearly impossible. A ledger is another name for a centralized record of
information – usually financial information like transaction data.

However, a blockchain’s ability to maintain consensus among distributed
computers means that they do not require the same sort of centralized
oversight as traditional ledgers.

This is what makes blockchains decentralized. Developers program blockchain
protocols to adhere to a strict set of rules. The protocol automatically
issues financial incentives to those who follow the rules, and penalties to
those who don’t.

It is this programmatic usage of incentives that allows blockchains to operate
without human management.

## Characteristics of a blockchain ledger

* * *

Before diving deeper into the technology, it is important to understand the
main characteristics of a blockchain.

Blockchain’s are:

  * **Auditable** – data stored on the blockchain can easily be tracked and verified.
  * **Distributed** – Blockchains often aim to remain outside the control of a single entity. They are often collectively managed by a broad set of volunteers.
  * **Immutable** – Once a transaction is recorded on the ledger, it can never be changed (or if it is, it must be agreed upon by at least 51% of nodes).
  * **Pseudonymous** \- Each user that interacts with the blockchain does so with a generated address that does not reveal their identity.

## How does a blockchain work?

* * *

Each computer that helps to update, manage and verify information on the
blockchain is known more specifically as a “node.” Nodes can perform a variety
of roles and anyone in the world with a smart device, an internet connection
and access to electricity can run a node.

As the name implies, blockchains are virtual blocks filled with data and
linked chronologically in a chain.

Each cryptocurrency will use an underlying blockchain to serve as its
distributed ledger, and rely on a community of nodes to manage it. This means
each time a user sends cryptocurrency to another, every node in the network
will assist in verifying the transaction. Each node then updates their own
version of the blockchain ledger accordingly to reflect the changes.

Nodes play a crucial role in running and securing blockchain networks and must
constantly work to record all updates to the network.

One of the major advantages of using a publicly distributed blockchain versus
a private bank ledger is that all nodes maintain their own copy of the
financial record.

Each of these nodes works together, without centralized oversight, to verify
transactions and information before they add to the blockchain database. Each
block of information is digitally chained to the previous block using
cryptographic techniques.

Not only does this promote transparency but it also makes blockchains
incredibly difficult to tamper with.

Changing just a single transaction on a blockchain ledger would require
altering the record of at least 51% of all nodes in that particular network –
something that would be incredibly difficult given the globally spread nature
of nodes.

## What can a blockchain be used for?

* * *

The highly secure and immutable nature of blockchains makes them ideal systems
for a large number of industries.

While some of these industries have been faster than others in adopting the
benefits of blockchain, all of them are exploring its potential. By
decentralizing information among users, blockchain has the potential to create
greater transparency across each of these industries.

Some use cases are well established and already being used by millions around
the world, while others are still in their proof-of-concept phase.

### **Decentralized cryptocurrencies  **

Blockchain technology’s original, and still most popular, use case is to power
cryptocurrencies.

The peer-to-peer, censorship-resistant nature of blockchains has allowed
developers to create all kinds of cryptocurrency projects that each serve a
range of different utilities:

  * Crypto assets like [Monero (XMR)](/prices/monero) and [Zcash (ZEC)](/prices/zcash) allow individuals to transact in a completely private manner.
  * Stablecoins such as [USD Coin (USDC)](/prices/usd-coin) and [Tether (USDT)](/prices/tether) peg their value to real-world assets. This provides users with a way of reducing volatility within their cryptocurrency portfolios. Learn more about these assets with our article [What are stablecoins?](/learn/what-are-stablecoins)
  * Some crypto assets such as [Uniswap (UNI)](/prices/uniswap) and [Curve (CRV)](/prices/curve-dao) serve as [governance tokens](/learn/what-is-a-governance-token), allowing holders to vote on decisions that affect the future direction of the blockchain protocol.
  * Other tokens such as [non-fungible tokens (NFTs)](/learn/what-are-non-fungible-tokens-nft) allow crypto users to prove and trade the ownership of unique digital items.

If you would like more information on how blockchains help power
cryptocurrencies, read our [What is Cryptocurrency?](/learn/what-is-
cryptocurrency) guide, which offers a more extensive explanation.

### **Financial services  **

Given that blockchains have proven their usefulness in managing digital money
supplies, major companies have sought to extend this technology to other types
of financial services.

As such, it’s believed blockchains could solve inefficiencies across many
parts of the financial system – including inter-bank transactions, clearing,
and settlements – that have typically been the domain of some of the world’s
largest and most opaque financial entities.

The idea is these institutions can use blockchain technology to cut costs,
better adhere to regulation, and generally upgrade the somewhat antiquated
technology that helps them run.

Examples of traditional institutions exploring blockchain-based solutions for
banking services include:

  * J.P. Morgan’s Onyx blockchain technology for exchanging value and data 
  * Santander using Ethereum’s blockchain to issue and manage a $20 million bond
  * Regulated Liability Network (RLN) - a conceptual shared blockchain ledger for major global banking institutions like Wells Fargo, HSBC, BNY Mellon, and Mastercard.

### **Supply chain management**

One of the most talked about use-cases for blockchain technology is managing
commercial supply chains.

Global trade is a trillion dollar industry, with goods and services being
shipped across the world daily. In order for something to travel from one
place to the next, multiple participants must rely on different systems to
track and process items.

Blockchain technology can help reduce the barriers formed from these different
systems, removing costs and potential points of failure along the way. From
retailers like WalMart to logistics providers like FedEx, the biggest
companies in the industry are exploring how blockchains can create
transparency and consistency across their supply chain records.

Some are even providing the blockchain infrastructure enterprises need to
start adopting blockchain. [Amazon’s Managed
Blockchain](https://aws.amazon.com/blockchain/blockchain-for-supply-chain-
track-and-trace/) is a leading example of a service that provides other
companies with tools for deploying their own private blockchain networks for
supply chain management.

### **Healthcare records**

Healthcare records today are often maintained by centralized data centers.
This brings added costs and risks to the entities entrusted with them.

The information within these records may be vulnerable to security breaches
and difficult to share with other hospitals around the world. By integrating
blockchain technology, however, there is some hope it could help solve these
long-standing issues. Blockchain technology offers a mechanism for recording
and maintaining comprehensive records while giving individuals more control
over their own data.

MedRec, Ancile, and OmniPHR are just some examples of solutions that leverage
blockchain technology for electronic health record management.

### **Insurance**

Insurance companies have been exploring the use of blockchain technology for
increasing operational efficiency for many years now.

In 2017, AIA launched its own blockchain-based insurance solution in Hong Kong
aimed at streamlining the data-sharing process with its banking partners.

In 2023, TradeWaltz launched its marine insurance blockchain solution. Two of
Japan’s largest insurance providers, Sompo and Tokio Marine, now provide
marine insurance products using TradeWaltz’s platform.

### **Energy**

Companies have also seen potential for blockchain-based infrastructure to
revolutionize the global energy industry. Siemens, in partnership with several
other projects, recently launched Pebbles — a peer-to-peer energy trading
market built on a blockchain.

Shell, Accenture and Amex GBT have also collaboratively launched their own
blockchain-based sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) solutions called Avelia.

[Power Ledger (POWR)](/prices/power-ledger) is an example of a cryptocurrency
project that uses blockchain technology to create peer-to-peer energy trading
markets. This allows people to tokenize and trade environmental commodities
such as carbon credits and renewable energy certificates.

### **Identity**

Handling client personal information requires highly secure, robust systems.
Information stored also needs to be accessible and tamper-proof, making
blockchains a perfect fit.

IBM’s Digital Credentials service has already tapped into this pioneering
technology to create a safe, auditable solution for identity management.

The World Economic Forum has also launched a blockchain-based Known Traveller
Digital Identity, or KTD, solution. Leveraging cryptography and blockchain,
KTD streamlines passenger travel by facilitating cross-border travel without
the need to produce physical documents.

### **Voting**

In a democratic society, voting plays a central role in determining the
outcomes of local and national elections. To produce accurate results, voting
systems need to be reliable, verifiable, and resistant to fraudulent
manipulation.

However, legacy voting systems have historically come under scrutiny for being
easy to defraud and delivering falsified results. These situations erode trust
and can lead to widespread civil unrest.

[Some experts](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2020/09/25/long-read-how-
blockchain-can-make-electronic-voting-more-secure/) have touted the
technological innovations of blockchain databases could put an end to
controversial elections.

Follow My Vote and Voatz are examples of blockchain-based voting solutions
that are seeking to provide US citizens with a more secure, trusted electoral
voting mechanism.

### **Item authentication**

The emergence of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) showcased how people can use
blockchains to track and verify the authenticity and ownership of digital
files such as audio clips and JPEG images — something that wasn’t possible
before the advent of blockchain technology.

Since then, other companies have created their own blockchain solutions for
tracking and verifying the authenticity of real items.

The Aura Blockchain Consortium, Authena, and Seal are examples of working
blockchain-based solutions for guaranteeing the provenance of particular
items.

##

## What are the components of blockchain?

* * *

Beyond a decentralized network of nodes, there are several other important
parts that make up a blockchain ledger.

### **Cryptography  **

Blockchains today are secured by cryptography — a system used for enciphering
and deciphering information for private communication over a public network.

In the early 1900s, military and spy agencies mainly used cryptography,
particularly during war time, where secret communication systems were vital
for sharing information between posts.

Today, cryptography plays a foundational role in the digital asset industry.
Projects leverage cryptographic techniques to secure transactions sent over
blockchain networks and allow users to prove who owns what funds.

You can learn more about the cryptography behind blockchains and
cryptocurrencies in our Kraken Learn Center article [How do cryptocurrencies
use cryptography?](/learn/how-do-cryptocurrencies-use-cryptography)

### **Distributed ledger**

Envisioned as an alternative to trusted databases, distributed ledgers aim to
allow users greater oversight into the maintenance of their data while
reducing liability for entities that might today serve as the central owner of
this sensitive information.

Given this impact, there are a variety of industries and organizations using
blockchains to set up trusted networks to streamline the sharing of
information and the record-keeping process, while improving their performance
and security.

### **Consensus mechanism**

A [consensus mechanism](/learn/what-is-blockchain-consensus-mechanism) is the
part of the blockchain protocol that establishes agreement among nodes on the
state of the ledger and the validity of transactions.

It ensures that all nodes in the network follow the rules, reach a common
understanding of the blockchain's current state, and agree on which

that enables decentralized trust and prevents double-spending and other forms
of fraud in a distributed ledger system.
