**What is an NFT?**

(Non-Fungible Token)

## What does NFT stand for?

NFT stands for **non-fungible token**. In short, non-fungible means **distinct
and unduplicatable** , while a token is a **digital asset  stored on a
blockchain**.

Although these three letters changed the concept of digital ownership for
many, they continue to cause confusion and frustration for others.

[Get started with Kraken NFT](/sign-up?nft)

## What are NFTs?

NFTs are blockchain-based digital records of ownership and authenticity
associated with a piece of media.

An NFT is more than a multimedia file (like a .gif or .jpeg) ⁠— it is a public
record of historic information associated with that media. In this way, NFTs
are more similar to a painting’s bill of ownership and certificate of
authenticity than the painted canvas itself.

NFTs are different from fungible assets like $20 bills, shares of a stock, or
other units which can be substituted for each other with no change in value.

While one $20 bill is worth the same amount as any other $20 dollar bill and
one new tennis ball can be exchanged for another without disrupting a match,
NFTs have distinct qualities that make each **unique and verifiably
different** from all other NFTs.

## Why are NFTs important?

An NFT serves as **proof of ownership** , delivering a highly tamper-resistant
way to mathematically verify that a certain blockchain address owns that item.

An NFT also serves as a **certificate of authenticity** which ensures that any
form of media (artwork, document or other digital file) can be traced back to
its origination (and thereby be proven not to have been tampered with since).

## NFTs explained

Taking a picture of a work of art hanging in a museum does not make the
photographer the owner of the painting, nor does it make the captured image
the original work of art.

We know this because there is consensus among intermediaries such as curators,
scholars, collectors and the public about which is the original, which is a
copy and who is the rightful owner.

The same is true of NFTs and this is what gives an original NFT – rather than
its right-click-saved copies – provable scarcity and value. But rather than
relying on the judgment of individuals to verify authenticity or ownership,
NFTs use the consensus-building power of blockchain technology.

In short, NFTs use objective mathematical proofs, rather than subjective trust
in an individual or organization, to verify ownership and authenticity.

## An extremely brief history of NFTs

Despite their recent rise to prominence, NFTs date back to the earliest years
of blockchain technology.

The concept of NFTs was introduced with Colored Coins in 2012. Stored on the
[Bitcoin](/prices/bitcoin) blockchain, Colored Coins offered a way to
represent ownership of real-world assets such as real estate or shares of a
stock. Years later, Digital artist Kevin McCoy’s “Quantum” ⁠– a hypnotic loop
of a pulsating, multicolored octagon – was minted on the Namecoin blockchain
and is widely regarded as the first NFT.

After the viral popularity of collections like Rare Pepes on the Bitcoin-based
Counterparty platform, [Ethereum](/prices/ethereum) advanced NFTs’ viability
with [CryptoKitties](/learn/what-are-cryptokitties-nft) and the ERC-721
standard in 2018. This paved the way for other smart-contract-enabled
blockchain networks such as [Solana](/prices/solana),
[Polygon](/prices/polygon), and [Tezos](/prices/tezos) to help further the
adoption and circulation of NFTs.

To date, NFTs have been most widely used to track the ownership and
authenticity of digital art and collectibles. Some of the earliest NFTs, such
as [CryptoPunks](/learn/what-are-cryptopunks), represent artifacts from the
first moments of a cultural shift in the concept of ownership. The
decentralized ownership use cases for NFTs in other realms beyond art, from
the verification of sensitive financial documents to exclusive access to pop
culture experiences, continue to grow.

## How do NFTs work?

NFTs, and the blockchain networks they exist on, employ concepts from
cryptography and computer science to securely maintain and share information.
They do this directly between individuals without the need for centralized
oversight and verification.

If you already knew this, you might want to read [Kraken Intelligence’s
report, Redefining Digital
Scarcity](https://kraken.docsend.com/view/964aiz4n3y5dti3s), which covers the
technical differences of NFT marketplaces like OpenSea and Rarible, as well as
NFT token standards like ERC-721 and ERC-1155.

But if you are just starting your blockchain and NFT education journey, you
are in the right place.

Blockchains use public-private key cryptography and hashing to share encrypted
information across a distributed network of users. This information is stored
in “blocks” which are “chained” together by including information from the
previous block in each new block. This approach of including information from
the previous block in each new block allows for a complete audit trail back to
the creation of the blockchain. It also makes it easy for the network to
identify if a block of information has somehow been tampered with.

Rather than maintaining these blocks of chained information in a single
location, blockchains distribute copies of this information across a network
of computers, each of which is individually referred to as a **node**.

Blockchains use a sophisticated computer program, referred to as a [consensus
algorithm](/learn/what-is-blockchain-consensus-mechanism), to maintain
agreement on the information that is committed to the network and shared
across participating nodes. This gives blockchains their defining
characteristics of being:

**Decentralized**

Blockchains rely on a shared set of predefined rules, rather than a human
intermediary, to maintain agreement on the validity of information they store.

**Distributed**

Information stored on a blockchain is not kept in a single location, but
across a network of computers, which share the same copy of historical data.

**Immutable**

Information kept on a blockchain cannot be changed, only added to, which
allows for a complete and highly tamper-resistant source of truth for all.

Check out the Kraken Learn Center’s complete guide to [What is Blockchain
Technology?](/learn/what-is-blockchain-technology) for a thorough overview.

NFTs are built using [smart contracts](/learn/what-are-smart-contracts),
programmatic rules committed to and executed on the blockchain. The smart
contract behind the NFT serves as tamper-resistant proof that the media
associated with the NFT was created by a specific person or organization. It
also proves the rightful owner of the item.

Ultimately, the deterministic rules of the smart contract managing the NFT
allow individuals to sidestep the oversight of error- or fraud-susceptible
centralized intermediaries.

[Ethereum](/learn/buy-ethereum-eth/), [Solana](/learn/buy-solana-sol/),
[Cardano](/learn/buy-cardano-ada/), [Flow](/learn/what-is-flow/) and
[Tezos](/learn/buy-tezos-xtz/) are just a few of the smart-contract-enabled
blockchain platforms that support the creation and maintenance of NFTs. While
each blockchain functions in a different way, they all deliver a
decentralized, distributed and immutable way of maintaining a shared record of
truth.

## How to make an NFT

On most blockchains, NFTs are created by interacting with a [smart
contract](/learn/what-are-smart-contracts).

Many smart contract templates for creating NFTs are available from a variety
of open sources, including the blockchain platforms that support NFTs,
prominent creators within the space and NFT marketplaces.

NFTs are created and registered on the blockchain through a process known as
**minting**. Nearly any piece of media, from a single line of text to an
entire virtual reality experience, can be minted as an NFT. Through the
minting process, the cryptographic address of the NFT’s creator and key pieces
of identifying information known as **metadata** are added to the blockchain.
The NFT is created and the digital media file the NFT represents is often
uploaded to an external location (more on that in the next section).

The smart contracts that create NFTs require a [gas fee](/learn/what-is-a-
blockchain-gas-fee) to be paid to network participants, known as
**validators** , who maintain the truthfulness of the NFT’s state of
ownership. Gas fees incentivize the validators to act honestly and stay in
agreement with others on the network.

## Securing and storing an NFT

NFTs are secured and maintained much like prominent cryptocurrencies such as
Bitcoin, [Polkadot](/prices/polkadot) and [Algorand](/prices/algorand). A
complete record of an NFT’s historical transactions and sequence of owners is
copied and shared across participating nodes. Each node contributes to
ensuring the security and accurate record-keeping of that NFT.

The consensus algorithm ensures all participating nodes across the network
stay in agreement. Consensus algorithms, such as [proof-of-work and proof-of-
stake](/learn/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake/), ensure that new transactions
are recorded and stored accurately by practically eliminating the potential to
tamper with the network or its contents.

While an NFT’s metadata, chain of custody and record of authenticity is stored
on the blockchain, the media an NFT represents is often not. Because storing
large image files directly on a blockchain can be expensive, many choose to
store the media file an NFT represents off-chain and point to it via a link
stored within the NFT on the blockchain.

It is important to fully understand where the media associated with an NFT is
stored and maintained, which is defined within the smart contract powering the
NFT, not by the method an individual chooses to custody an NFT. While
centralized media storage solutions offer convenience, they could make the
media more vulnerable to modification or deletion. Decentralized alternatives,
such as [Arweave](/prices/arweave) or the Interplanetary File System (IPFS),
have emerged as potential solutions that address many of the vulnerabilities
associated with centralized media storage services.

## NFT transactions

NFTs can be bought, sold and traded directly between individuals or through a
marketplace that facilitates such transactions. Many NFT marketplaces also
offer bidding functionality, rather than only a fixed price, to enable better
price discovery.

Because non-fungible items have no equivalent, NFT markets are generally
considered less liquid than more fungible asset markets like those for
cryptocurrencies or financial securities. Just like pieces sold in the
traditional art market, an NFT’s value is derived almost entirely from what
another secondary market participant is willing to pay for it.

The programmability of NFTs also offers an innovative way to compensate
digital content creators, rather than the latest owners, for creativity and
intellectual property. The smart contracts powering NFTs can be programmed to
grant fees to different predetermined blockchain addresses. The original
creator of an NFT can choose to include a **creator earning** , a cut of the
sale price that compensates the original creator each time that NFT is resold.

## What are NFTs used for?

### Art & Collectibles

While nearly any digital file can be represented as an NFT, the most common
use cases today are collectible, digital artworks. Prior to NFTs, the most
significant critique of digital art or collectibles was that ownership of a
piece of art or baseball card was almost impossible to track online and relied
heavily on fraud-susceptible intermediaries.  
  
NFTs have further legitimized digital art as a medium and a valuable form of
expression in modern culture. NFTs from so-called “blue chip” collections
(e.g.,
[CryptoPunks](https://nft.kraken.com/explore/collections?collectionId=NCZRVRU-7YGFA-
QWP5VE), [Bored Ape Yacht
Club](https://nft.kraken.com/explore/collections?collectionId=NCL24XT-
MDL23-ME56PF) and works from digital artists such as Beeple) have set sale
price records not only for NFT marketplaces, but for traditional art auction
houses as well.

### Community Membership

Many NFT collections offer exclusive real-world perks, rewards or experiences
to their holders, creating additional value.

Those holding NFTs from certain collections often connect with other owners to
network, develop relationships and share in their passion for the project, all
while fostering a deeper sense of community membership.

Additionally, several [decentralized autonomous organizations
(DAOs)](/learn/what-is-decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao) have come
together to share in the fractional ownership and collective management of
NFTs they have determined to be culturally significant.

### Music

Musicians are using NFTs to reduce the influence of record labels and the
wider music industry, which mediates and monetizes the relationship artists
have with their fans. Just as unique images can be committed to the blockchain
as NFTs, unique clips of audio can also be created, transacted and stored on
the blockchain as NFTs for fans to own and enjoy.

Scores of musical artists across genres and generations, including Kings of
Leon and 3LAU, are using NFTs to foster new experiences with their music and
offset their reliance on the intermediaries of the music industry.

### Gaming

Blockchain-based platforms like [Decentraland](/learn/buy-decentraland-mana/),
[Axie Infinity](/learn/buy-axie-infinity-shards-axs/) and [The
Sandbox](/learn/buy-sandbox-sand/) use NFTs to offer unique in-game
experiences and reward players with bespoke items that have real-world value.
Within these games, NFTs can represent distinct plots of virtual land,
characters, abilities or wearables, each with their own attributes and market
value. NFTs, and the cryptocurrencies native to many blockchain games, are
also key parts of the play-to-earn economy, rewarding players’ in-game
achievements with items that have a value outside of in-game marketplaces.
NFTs allow players to take ownership over their gaming accomplishments and
reap bespoke rewards that have real-world value.

### DeFi

NFTs are also seeing innovative use cases with [decentralized finance
(DeFi)](/learn/what-is-decentralized-finance-defi) protocols as a way to
maintain tamper-proof records of ownership without intermediaries. Important
financial documentation, such as a proof of ownership of a piece of land or a
business’ tax filing could be created as an NFT and used within a DeFi
protocol to reliably execute a peer-to-peer blockchain transaction. Beyond
their proof of ownership and authenticity use cases, NFTs can also be used as
collateral for users to borrow against. Both traditional and blockchain-based
lending services are exploring how the value of an NFT can be used to fund new
financial products and services.

### The Metaverse and Web3

NFTs are fast becoming a fundamental building block for the next generation of
the internet, where more immersive online experiences can be delivered through
the bespoke ownership properties of NFTs.

NFTs have the potential to empower a more decentralized and anonymized
blockchain-based internet architecture, often referred to as Web3. While the
full scope of NFTs’ potential within these realms is still emerging, NFTs will
likely continue to play a crucial role in developing Web3 and the metaverse.
Many feel art is only the first of many areas to be revolutionized by the
potential of NFTs, with e-commerce, land ownership and even personal identity
use cases soon to follow.

### Proof of Attendance Protocol

Proof of Attendance Protocol (POAP) is an open source project that uses NFTs
to track attendance of real world events. After providing a simple badge
design and metadata associated with an event (such as the event’s name,
location and date) POAPs can be distributed to create a tamper-proof digital
record of participation that is easily shared and verified.  
  
POAP enables event organizers to offer more personalized experiences for their
communities. This type of non-fungible token has the potential to expand into
other areas such as tracking credentials from academic institutions and
professional organizations, as well.

### Fashion

From boutique luxury brands to fast-fashion powerhouses, companies around the
world are exploring the power of NFTs.

Several prominent brands are launching NFT collections of clothing fit for the
metaverse, while others like Louis Vuitton are developing entire games
centering around collecting NFTs and engaging with the brand.  
  
NFTs deepen connection with customers while placing a spotlight on inspiring
new artists. Gucci, Dolce & Gabbana, Nike and Adidas are just a few of the
tastemakers that have tapped into the power of NFTs to create trendsetting
experiences.

NFTs are here to stay.

New and exciting collections and applications hit the NFT market daily,
creating an ever-more-diverse marketplace to explore.
