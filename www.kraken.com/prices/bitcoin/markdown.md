## What is Bitcoin (BTC)

Bitcoin (BTC) is the world's first globally viable cryptocurrency built with
blockchain technology.

Outlined in 2008 by an anonymous developer under the pseudonym Satoshi
Nakamoto, Bitcoin remains the most widely accepted and traded cryptocurrency
today.

Nakamoto conceived Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that had
no need for a central authority or single administrator. A global team of
developers continues to maintain and work on the improvement of the Bitcoin
protocol.



## **Who created Bitcoin?**

An unknown programmer published the Bitcoin white paper under the pseudonym
"Satoshi Nakamoto'' in 2008. Satoshi Nakamoto may be an individual or a group
of people.

Despite the widespread use and popularity of Bitcoin, the true identity of
Satoshi Nakamoto remains a mystery. Over the years, many people have claimed
to be the real Satoshi Nakamoto, but none of them have been able to provide
definitive evidence to support their claims.

Whoever Nakamoto is or was, they went to great lengths to remain anonymous.
This mystery has helped increase the appeal of bitcoin as a global currency
and fascination surrounding the origins of Bitcoin.

Those closely related to cryptography around the time of Bitcoin's conception
remain the most prominent suspects. These include computer programmers [Nick
Szabo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Szabo) and the late [Hal
Finney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hal_Finney_\(computer_scientist\)).

Miners created the Bitcoin genesis block on January 3, 2009.



## **How does Bitcoin work?**

The **Bitcoin network** is a decentralized virtual currency system that
operates without a central bank, government authority, or middleman. Instead,
it uses concepts from cryptography, computer science, and game theory to
maintain a decentralized network of computers around the world that
collectively uphold the integrity of the system.

This globally distributed community of nodes is what makes up the Bitcoin
network. Each node plays an important role in helping to maintain the network
and validate transactions. Because there are multiple copies of the Bitcoin
blockchain spread across multiple nodes, there is no central authority that
controls the blockchain.

Anyone in the world can run their own node and participate in managing the
Bitcoin network. Every node maintains their own copy of the bitcoin
blockchain, which is an unchangeable ledger of cryptocurrency transactions.

Nodes store all transactions on a public ledger called the **Bitcoin
blockchain** , which serves as a fully accessible, transparent database. This
digital ledger stores all bitcoin transactions as well as user balances in the
form of unspent transaction outputs, or UTXOs. Once the system writes
something to the ledger, it is effectively permanent, since it can never be
changed, only updated.

When someone sends Bitcoin to another person, the transaction is verified by a
network of miners, which are computers that solve complex mathematical
problems. This process ultimately helps to ensure the validity of information
stored on the blockchain network.



**How is the Bitcoin network secured?**

Bitcoin, and many other types of cryptocurrencies, borrows concepts from
cryptograph, computer science, and game theory to operate the network.

Cryptographic hash functions and the proof-of-work consensus mechanism are two
of the most significant features that help to secure the Bitcoin network.

Bitcoin uses the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to validate
transactions before they are permanently committed to the Bitcoin blockchain.
PoW involves miners expelling computational resources to “prove” that “work”
has gone into verifying transactions on the blockchain network. The protocol
rewards the miner who proves the validity of a batch of transactions with
newly created bitcoin. This process of distributing new bitcoin as a reward
for validating new transactions takes place every ~10 minutes.



### **Bitcoin mining**

The process of validating transactions on the blockchain by solving complex
mathematical problems is called bitcoin mining.

Crypto mining is critical to the Bitcoin network's security and integrity.
Miners use specialized hardware and software to compete for the chance to
solve a cryptographic puzzle and receive bitcoin in return. Once a block of
transactions is verified, miners add it to the blockchain ledger, creating an
unalterable record of all transactions on the network.

Although the solution to the problem is easy for anyone to check, finding the
solution is computationally demanding and requires a significant amount of
energy. This decentralized process is also designed to prevent fraudulent
activities like the “double-spending” of the same coins.

As more miners join the network, the difficulty of these mathematical problems
increases, making it more difficult to earn rewards.

The decentralized nature of the blockchain ledger also helps to enhance the
security of the network. Nodes are distributed across the globe and maintain
their own personal copy of the ledger. This important factor means there is no
single point of failure. Even if 99% of nodes go down, a single node could
recover the entire Bitcoin blockchain.



**Bitcoin's energy consumption**

The cost of the decentralization and security that the Bitcoin protocol offers
is the computational power and energy the protocol consumes. This has caused
some to raise concerns about Bitcoin’s long run sustainability and
scalability, though many feel these factors are often misrepresented.

The specialized mining rigs used in the mining process consume electrical
energy. Energy usage increases as more miners join the network because the
difficulty to mine a block algorithmically increases as more hashing power
joins the network. This, in turn, results in higher electricity costs for
miners.

While bitcoin miners are incentivized to keep their costs down and therefore
use renewable energy sources, the overall environmental impact of mining
bitcoins is still widely scrutinized.

As demand for Bitcoin continues to grow, an increasing number of miners are
finding more sustainable ways to power the mining process, reduce their carbon
footprint, and minimize their environmental impact.

##  

## **Bitcoin tokenomics**

Tokenomics refers to the economic design behind how the cryptocurrency
operates. This includes how many units of the asset will ever exist, as well
as how those units enter circulation over time.

Bitcoin enters circulation as a reward for miners proving the validity of new
batches of transactions. Unlike traditional government currencies, which can
be created at will and have an infinite supply, Bitcoin’s supply is limited to
a hard cap of 21 million coins.

A process called bitcoin halvings systematically reduces the block reward over
time (by half) until all units of bitcoin are mined.

This process is not deflationary, meaning that it does not remove bitcoin from
circulation. However, each halving does taper down the amount of new coins
entering into circulation. As rewards are cut in half every ~ four years,
miners are expected to mine the last bitcoin in the year 2140.

##  

## **How Bitcoin transactions work**

Bitcoin transactions involve the transfer of digital currency ownership
between two parties without the need for an intermediary.

When you send Bitcoin to someone, the transaction is broadcasted to the
Bitcoin network. Miners compete against each other to verify and add the
transaction to the blockchain, which is a public ledger that records all
Bitcoin transactions. Bitcoin transaction fees are payments made by senders to
miners. These fees serve as an incentive for miners to include the sender's
transactions in the next block on the blockchain.

Once a miner validates the transaction, the recipient will then see the
Bitcoin in their digital wallet balance. Bitcoin transactions are secure,
fast, and transparent, making it an attractive option for cross-border
payments.

The bitcoin blockchain is composed of blocks of transactions. The size of
blocks limits the number of transactions that miners can process in each
block. Larger block sizes enable miners to confirm more transactions at once.
However, increasing block sizes also increases the computational power and
storage requirements necessary to process each block.

##  

## **How to store bitcoin**

To send, receive or store Bitcoin, you need a digital wallet, also known as a
crypto wallet. There are several different types of crypto wallets, each with
their own benefits and drawbacks. Popular bitcoin wallet options include
desktop, mobile, online, and hardware wallets. Each offers unique features and
security levels that help to keep your crypto safe.

Many feel that desktop wallets offer a higher level of security, while mobile
wallets offer a greater level of convenience. Most online wallets are cloud-
based, while hardware wallets store Bitcoin offline for maximum protection.

Broadly speaking, all types of bitcoin wallets can be broken down into two
separate categories: hardware and software wallets.

###  

### **Hardware wallet**

A hardware cryptocurrency wallet (also known as a cold wallet) is a physical
device that stores a user's private keys securely. Private keys are used to
sign transactions and allow users to spend their bitcoins. Hardware wallets
are considered one of the most secure ways to store bitcoin because they
remain disconnected from the internet most of the time. This makes them less
susceptible to hacking attempts.

A hardware wallet works by generating a private key that the device stores
internally. A PIN protects the private key or password that only the user
knows.

###  

### **Software wallet**

A software wallet (known as a hot wallet) is a digital wallet that stores your
Bitcoin and other popular cryptocurrency on a software platform. These wallets
are typically free to download and easy to use.

People can access their software hot wallets through a computer, smartphone,
or tablet. Software wallets are convenient because they allow you to access
your Bitcoin from anywhere, as long as you have internet access. However, they
are also more vulnerable to hacking and malware attacks, making them less
secure than hardware wallets.

##  

## **Who are the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin?**

As of April 2023, the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin include
MicroStrategy, Tesla (founded by Elon Musk), and Square. Many other companies
and institutional investors have also invested in Bitcoin as a hedge against
inflation and a potential store of value.

##  

## **BTC vs ETH**

Bitcoin and Ethereum are two popular decentralized digital currencies, but
they differ in significant ways. Bitcoin is a digital currency designed for
peer-to-peer transactions, though many use it as a speculative investment or
store of value.

Ethereum, on the other hand, is a platform for building decentralized
applications and deploying smart contracts.

While Bitcoin uses a proof-of-work consensus algorithm to validate
transactions, Ethereum has now transitioned to a proof-of-stake algorithm in a
process known as The Ethereum Merge. The Merge aimed to lay the foundation for
improvements for Ethereum’s energy efficiency and scalability.

Compared to Bitcoin, Ethereum also has a more extensive range of programming
languages and tools for developers to create decentralized applications.



## **Bitcoin markets**

The Bitcoin market is a part of the larger crypto market, where
cryptocurrencies compete for dominance. Bitcoin is considered the crypto
market standard, with the largest market capitalization of all
cryptocurrencies.

The bitcoin market can be influenced by investor sentiment, leading to bullish
or bearish trends.

Market participants include traders, investors, and institutions. Over the
years, the rise in institutional involvement means Bitcoin and other
cryptocurrencies are becoming increasingly relevant in financial markets.
Today, investors can speculate on the price of bitcoin using financial
derivatives such as [futures contracts](/features/futures) and other types of
crypto derivatives.

Understanding market trends and developments is essential for anyone looking
to invest or trade in the crypto market.
