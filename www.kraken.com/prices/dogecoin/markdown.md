## What is Dogecoin (DOGE)

Dogecoin is a decentralized, peer-to-peer cryptocurrency centering around the
"Doge" meme, which serves as its mascot.

Built using blockchain technology, Dogecoin (DOGE) was once a popular tipping
cryptocurrency and fundraising mechanism for multiple charitable causes.

Dogecoin features the likeness of the Shiba Inu dog popularized in the "Doge"
meme. The cryptocurrency first appeared as a light-hearted marketing
experiment in 2013. DOGE quickly gained a massive audience in the crypto
market and now boasts one of the largest market caps in the industry. _Much
wow. Doge is pleased._

The success and virality of Dogecoin spurred the creation of other Shiba Inu-
themed projects thereby launching an entirely new crypto industry sector of
"meme coins." [Shiba Inu Coin (SHIB)](/prices/shiba-inu) is a leading example
of a popular spin-off with a similarly large market capitalization.

##  

## **Who created Dogecoin?**

Dogecoin was created by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer in
2013 as a joke cryptocurrency based on the popular "Doge" meme.

Markus developed the software and Palmer came up with the idea of using the
Shiba Inu dog from the meme as the coin's mascot. Initially, the creators
didn't take the currency seriously, but it gained a significant following on
social media, and was listed on various cryptocurrency exchanges.

Over time, Dogecoin became renowned for its enthusiastic and supportive
community. Despite its origins as a joke, Dogecoin has since become a
legitimate player in the crypto community and wider market.

##  

## **How does the DOGE token work?**

Dogecoin operates using a proof-of-work-based (PoW) consensus mechanism and
has an inflationary supply of coins. This fact means that there is no cap on
the maximum supply of coins that the protocol can create.

Initially, Palmer and Markus agreed to set the max supply at 100 billion
coins. However, the co-founders later removed this feature to keep prices low
and encourage users to send tokens to one another.

Dogecoin's inflationary nature means its native digital asset DOGE, is not
typically recommended as a reliable store of value.

As of April 2023, the current supply of Dogecoins is over 130 billion DOGE,
with a maximum supply of 10,000 DOGE per block. The balance of supply is
constantly changing as new coins are minted through mining. This steady influx
of fixed block rewards means the inflation rate technically decreases over
time.

Dogecoin's inflationary supply allows for a more flexible and adaptable
ecosystem that can respond to market demands.

Palmer and Markus created Dogecoin as a fork of Lucky Coin, an open-source
proof-of-work project forked from [Litecoin](/prices/litecoin). Because of
this, Dogecoin uses the Scrypt mining algorithm instead of the SHA-256 mining
algorithm used by Bitcoin.

##  

## **How do you mine Dogecoin?**

Dogecoin mining is the process of validating transactions and adding new
blocks to the blockchain network. The Dogecoin mining process is similar to
the bitcoin mining process, where miners use powerful computers to solve
complex mathematical equations. The Dogecoin protocol rewards successful
miners with newly minted DOGE for their efforts. It also dynamically adjusts
the mining difficulty and reward rate to maintain a stable rate of block
production and incentivize mining activity.

Mining pools such as Antpool and F2pool are popular ways for people to pool
together their mining resources. This option can improve a person's odds of
earning DOGE mining rewards.



## **What can you do with Dogecoin?**

DOGE holders predominantly use Dogecoin as a digital asset payment system
(medium of exchange) for electronically transferring value between one
another. It was once one of the most widely used tipping digital assets in the
cryptocurrency market due to its low fees and ease-of-use.

Many also buy and hold DOGE as a highly speculative investment. This
speculation is largely due to the historical impacts that Elon Musk's
Dogecoin-related tweets have had on its price. As a result, the dog-themed
cryptocurrency is especially volatile. Doge prices can swing wildly in both
directions (surge in price increase or decrease) rapidly from a single social
media message.

##  

## **What is Dogecoin’s Libdogecoin?**

Libdogecoin is a software library that offers developers a range of tools and
resources for developing decentralized applications (dApps). It is a
collaborative, open-source initiative that aims to streamline the process of
building new dApps on top of Dogecoin's blockchain network.

Libdogecoin includes features for sending and receiving Dogecoin, as well as
advanced capabilities such as multi-sig transactions, HD wallets, and payment
channels. With Libdogecoin, developers can tap into Dogecoin's unique features
and create innovative new applications that harness the power of decentralized
technology.

##  

## **Who owns Dogecoin?**

Dogecoin has been a fully decentralized cryptocurrency project since Jackson
Palmer and Billy Markus both left Dogecoin in 2015. Now, its community of
users and voluntary developers share control over the project.

It has gained significant attention in recent years due to its celebrity
endorsements from the likes of Mark Cuban, Snoop Dogg, and Elon Musk. In fact,
Elon Musk's comments about Dogecoin becoming the currency of the future has
only added to its popularity and appeal among both crypto enthusiasts and
casual investors alike.

However, ultimately it is the community of Dogecoin users who determine its
usage as a digital currency.

##  

## **Dogecoin vs Bitcoin**

Dogecoin and Bitcoin are both decentralized cryptocurrencies, but they differ
in several key ways. Firstly, Dogecoin has a much larger supply than Bitcoin.
There is an unlimited maximum supply of Dogecoin compared to Bitcoin's fixed
supply of 21 million units.

Compared to Bitcoin, Dogecoin has a much faster block time, meaning
transactions are executed faster with Dogecoin than Bitcoin. Miners produce
new Dogecoin blocks every minute, compared to Bitcoin's average block time of
10 minutes. Finally, Dogecoin is seen as more of a "fun" and lighthearted
cryptocurrency, while Bitcoin is often viewed as a serious investment vehicle.



Despite these differences, both currencies have their own unique use cases and
have gained significant attention from investors in recent years.

**Crypto Asset General Risks**

  * Investing in crypto assets is risky and each token can have its own set of risks. Below is a list of risks that generally apply to all crypto assets:
  * Volatility: The performance of crypto assets can be highly volatile, with their value dropping as quickly as it can rise. You should be prepared to lose all the money you invest in crypto assets.
  * Lack of protections: Crypto asset investments are unregulated and neither the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) nor the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) will assist or protect you in the event something goes wrong with your crypto asset investments.
  * Liquidity: Some crypto asset markets may suffer for low liquidity which could prevent you buying or selling your crypto assets at the price you want or expect.
  * Complexity: Specific crypto assets may carry with them specific complex risks that are hard to understand. Do your own research and if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

Don’t put all your eggs in one basket: Putting all your money into a single
type of investment is risky. Spreading your money across different investments
makes you less dependent on any one to do well.
