FAQs

## API trading

  1. ### **What is API trading?**

An application programming interface (API) connects two applications together,
such as a trader’s customized trading software and Kraken’s market data
stream. Kraken’s API products let traders connect and control their Kraken
accounts using their own or third-party software. This allows traders to use
custom code for market analysis and automated trading strategies via Kraken.

* * *

  2. ### How does crypto API trading work?

Traders can use Kraken API products to build and execute a variety of
strategies at high speed while reacting to changing market conditions. API
trading strategies can also be automated to run without the trader’s
intervention. All you need to trade using API is a Kraken account, your own or
third-party software, and an API key to connect both applications. In this
way, API trading is more similar to creating the parameters by which a trading
program should execute orders, rather than manually placing trades
individually.

* * *

  3. ### Who benefits from crypto API trading?

High-frequency traders and arbitrageurs typically benefit the most from API
trading thanks to the speed at which software can seize market opportunities.
Institutional and individual traders alike can use API trading to execute a
large number of orders in fractions of a second. API data streams also allow
traders to run their own market analysis software that can inform their
trading strategies.

* * *

  4. ### What is algorithmic trading?

Algorithmic trading is a trading strategy performed by computers reacting to
an array of market data. Sometimes called “bot trading,” algorithmic trading
involves the automated interpretation of market data into a computer-executed
trading strategy. While trading may be automated, traders often observe their
algorithmic systems to hone the software and overall strategy.

* * *

  5. ### Does Kraken allow trading bots?

Yes, clients are welcome to use trading bots to trade our markets. You can
learn more about connecting a trading bot to your Kraken account on our
Support Center: [Does Kraken allow trading
bots](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001373983)?

* * *

  6. ### What countries can use Kraken’s API?
