**KRAKEN LEGAL DISCLOSURES**



Last updated: Feb 8, 2024



PLEASE READ THESE LEGAL DISCLOSURES CAREFULLY. BY ACCESSING OR USING THE
SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO BE LEGALLY BOUND BY THESE DISCLOSURES.



_Digital Assets._ The term “digital asset(s)” does not refer to any legal or
regulatory category under any national framework. The value of digital assets
can be volatile and there can be a substantial risk that you lose money
buying, selling, holding, or investing in digital assets. Each digital asset
has unique features and you should research and understand an asset before you
trade. Kraken is not an affiliate of the project teams of digital assets
listed on Kraken’s platform.



_Not Investment Advice._ The information about digital assets on any Kraken
website (including www.kraken.com and blog.kraken.com), the Kraken exchange,
e-mails, or any other communications is for general information purposes only.
Kraken does not provide investment, tax, or legal advice, and you are solely
responsible for determining whether any investment, investment strategy or
related transaction is appropriate for you based on your personal investment
objectives, financial circumstances, and risk tolerance. The information
should not be construed as a recommendation or solicitation to buy, sell,
stake, or hold any digital asset or to open an account or engage in any
specific trading strategy. You should consult your financial advisor, or legal
or tax professional regarding your specific situation and financial condition
and carefully consider whether trading, staking, or holding digital assets is
suitable for you.



_Kraken Ventures._ Kraken holds tokens on its balance sheet for operational
purposes or other reasons. Kraken Ventures, in which Kraken is a limited
partner, is an investor in certain tokens. Kraken may therefore benefit from
listing certain tokens on the platform. However, Kraken Ventures may be
subject to a contractual lock-up for a period of time after its investment
during which it cannot sell the tokens. All tokens, regardless of whether held
by Kraken or Kraken Ventures, are subject to the same strict review process
and guidelines in determining whether to make them available to trade on
Kraken.



_No Insurance._ Digital assets and Kraken accounts are not covered by
insurance against losses.  They are not subject to Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation or Securities Investor Protection Corporation protections in the
United States or the protections of any comparable organization anywhere in
the world.

Please note the following disclosures associated with virtual currency:



Virtual currency is not legal tender in the United States and is not backed by
the United States government.  Payward Ventures, Inc. is not a bank or
depository institution insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
and virtual currency is not subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
or Securities Investor Protection Corporation protections.



Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal, or
international level may adversely affect the value of virtual currency.



Transactions in virtual currency may be irreversible, and accordingly, losses
due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable.



Some virtual currency transactions may be immediately effective when recorded
on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that the
customer initiates the transaction.



The value of virtual currency may be derived from the continued willingness of
market participants to exchange legal tender for virtual currency, which may
result in the potential for permanent and total loss of value of a particular
virtual currency if the market for the virtual currency declines or collapses
for an extended period of time.



Any surety bond required by law for the benefit of customers may not be
sufficient to cover all losses incurred by customers.



Customers should perform research before purchasing or investing in virtual
currency.
