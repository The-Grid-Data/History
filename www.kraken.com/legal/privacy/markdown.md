we will rely on your consent. It is also in our legitimate interest to
customize our services and content for clients and to recognise clients, in
order to ensure that clients receive the services and content that are

Biographical information and contact information, financial information,
trading information, PEP information (where relevant), verification

To the extent legitimate interest or performance of a contract is not a
recognized legal justification in your jurisdiction, we rely on consent
(express or implied, as appropriate) where consent is required.

## **7\. Disclosure of your personal data**

As part of processing your personal data for the purposes set out above,
Kraken may disclose your personal data to any members of the Kraken company
group, and to third parties. For example, Kraken may disclose your personal
data to any of our service providers and business partners, for business or
other legitimate purposes, such as specialist advisors who have been
contracted to provide us with administrative, financial, legal, tax,
compliance, insurance, IT, debt-recovery, analytics, research or other
services.

If Kraken discloses your personal data to service providers and business
partners, in order to perform the services requested by clients or to comply
with our legal and regulatory obligations, such providers and partners may
store your personal data within their own systems. We require them to protect
the confidentiality of this personal data, and comply with all relevant
privacy and data protection laws.



## **8\. Where we store your personal data**

Our operations are supported by a network of computers, servers, other
infrastructure and information technology, and third-party service providers.
We and our third-party service providers and business partners store and
process your personal data in the European Union, Japan, Australia, the United
Kingdom, the United States of America and elsewhere in the world. Courts, law
enforcement and security agencies of these jurisdictions may be able to use
legal processes to access your personal data.



## **9\. For UK & EEA clients: Transfers of personal  data outside of the
European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK)**

We may transfer your personal data outside the EEA and UK to other Kraken
group companies, service providers and business partners. Transfers outside of
the EEA or the UK (as appropriate) shall be in accordance with lawful transfer
mechanisms. If personal data is transferred to a country which has been found
by the European Commission to have an essentially equivalent standard of data
protection to the EEA, then Kraken may rely on an ‘adequacy decision’ to
transfer that personal data. See [here](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-
topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-
decisions_en#:~:text=The%20European%20Commission%20has%20so,Uruguay%20as%20providing%20adequate%20protection.)
for a list of countries with adequacy decisions. If personal data is
transferred from the EEA or UK to the US, we may rely on standard contractual
clauses.



## **10\. Privacy when using digital assets and  blockchains**

Your use of digital assets may be recorded on a public blockchain. Public
blockchains are distributed ledgers, intended to immutably record transactions
across wide networks of computer systems. Many blockchains are open to
forensic analysis which can lead to re-identification of transacting
individuals and the revelation of personal data, especially when blockchain
data is combined with other data.

As blockchains are decentralized or third-party networks which are not
controlled or operated by Kraken, we are not able to erase, modify, or alter
personal data on such networks.



## **11\. Data retention**

When personal data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it may
lawfully be processed, we will remove any details that will identify you, or
we will securely destroy the relevant records. We may need to maintain records
for a significant period of time after you cease being our client for legal or
regulatory reasons, for example when we need to retain information to help
manage a dispute or legal claim. Additionally, we are subject to certain anti-
money laundering laws which may require us to retain the following for a
period (e.g., 5 years) after our business relationship with you has ended:  


  * A copy of the records we used in order to comply with our client due diligence obligations;
  * Supporting evidence and records of transactions with you, and your relationship with us.

If you have opted out of receiving marketing communications we will hold your
details on our suppression list so that we know you do not want to receive
these communications.

We may keep your personal data for longer than 5 years if we cannot delete it
for legal, regulatory, or technical reasons.



## **12\. Cookies**

When you use our products and services or visit our websites, we may place
tiny data files called cookies, flash cookies, pixel tags, or other tracking
tools (herein, “Cookies”) on your computer or other devices used when engaging
with us. We use cookies to help us recognize you as a customer, collect
information about your use of our products and services, to better customize
our services and content for you, and to collect information about your
computer or other access devices to ensure our compliance with our U.S. Bank
Secrecy Act, fraud, security, sanctions and AML obligations.



## **13\. Your rights regarding your personal  data**

The rights that are available to you in relation to the personal data we
process are outlined below. You may request to exercise these rights subject
to any limitations provided for under applicable data protection laws.

**Access**

You can ask us to confirm whether we are processing your personal data and, if
so, what information we process and to provide you with a copy of that
information.

**Rectification**

It is important to us that your personal data is up to date. We will take all
reasonable steps to make sure that your personal data remains accurate,
complete and up-to-date. Please inform us if your personal data changes. If
the personal data we hold about you is inaccurate or incomplete, you are
entitled to have it rectified. If we have disclosed your personal data to
others, we will let them know about the rectification where possible. If you
ask us, and if possible and lawful to do so, we will also inform you with whom
we have shared your personal data.

You may inform us at any time that your personal details have changed by
emailing us at [support@kraken.com](mailto:support@kraken.com). Subject to
applicable law, Kraken will change your personal data in accordance with your
instructions. To proceed with such requests, in some cases we may need
supporting documents from you as proof i.e. personal data that we are required
to keep for regulatory or other legal purposes.

**Erasure**

You can ask us to delete or remove your personal data in certain
circumstances. Such requests may be subject to any retention limits we are
required to comply with in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. If
we have disclosed your personal data to others, we will let them know about
the erasure request where possible. If you ask us, and if possible and lawful
to do so, we will also inform you with whom we have shared your personal data.

**Processing restrictions**

You can ask us to block or suppress the processing of your personal data in
certain circumstances such as if you contest the accuracy of that personal
data or object to us processing it. It will not stop us from storing your
personal data. If we have disclosed your personal data to others, we will let
them know about the restriction of processing if possible. If you ask us, and
if possible and lawful to do so, we will also inform you with whom we have
shared your personal data.

**Data portability**

In certain circumstances you may have the right to obtain personal data you
have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable
format, and to re-use it elsewhere or ask us to transfer this to a third party
of your choice, where technically feasible.

**Objection**

You can ask us to stop processing your personal data, and we will do so, if we
are:

  * Relying on our own or someone else’s legitimate interests to process your personal data except if we can demonstrate compelling legal grounds for the processing or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims;
  * Processing your personal data for direct marketing; or
  * Processing your personal data for research unless we reasonably believe such processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest (such as by a regulatory or enforcement agency).

**Automated decision-making and profiling**

If we have made a decision about you based solely on an automated process
(e.g. through automatic profiling) that affects your ability to access our
products and services or has another significant effect on you, you can
request not to be subject to such a decision unless we can demonstrate to you
that such decision is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a
contract between you and us. Even if a decision is necessary for entering into
or performing a contract, you may contest the decision and require human
intervention. We may not be able to offer our products or services to you, if
we agree to such a request (i.e. end our relationship with you).

**Complaints**

You have the right to complain to a competent data protection authority.
Contact details are set out in Section 17 below. We ask that you first contact
[support@kraken.com](mailto:support@kraken.com) to give us an opportunity to
address any concerns.

**Withdraw consent**

You have the right to withdraw consent to processing based on consent at any
time. Note this will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent
prior to the withdrawal of consent or on grounds where consent is not
required.



## **14\. Changes to this privacy notice**

Our privacy notice is reviewed regularly in light of new regulations,
technologies, and any changes to our business operations. Any personal data we
process will be governed by our most recent privacy notice. We will update the
“Last updated” date accordingly at the beginning of this privacy notice.
Please review this privacy notice from time to time. We will announce any
material changes to this privacy notice on our website.



## **15\. Our products and services are not available to children**

Our products and services are not directed to persons under the age of 18
(herein, “Children”, “Child”) and we do not knowingly collect personal data
from children. If we learn that we have inadvertently processed personal data
from a child, we will take legally permissible measures to remove that data
from our records. Kraken will require the child user to close his or her
account and will not allow the use of our products and services. If you are a
parent or guardian of a child, and you become aware that a child has provided
personal data to us, please contact us at
[support@kraken.com](mailto:support@kraken.com).
