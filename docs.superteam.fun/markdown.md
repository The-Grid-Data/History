# 👋Welcome to Superteam

This workspace is raw, WIP, and meant for our community. We're turning our
organization inside-out so you can lurk, find opportunities and join us on
this adventure.

###

What is Superteam?

We help the most promising projects in the Solana ecosystem in the ascending
world (India, South East Asia, Eastern Europe, and Africa) launch and grow.

We are organised as a co-operative of creatives, developers, and operators who
are experienced in launching and growing technology businesses. To learn more
about our structure and how we're set up, check out the resource below.

###

What are Our Goals?

  1. **Help Solana Founders Win.** We believe in the power of the Solana ecosystem to power the inevitable wave of consumer adoption in Web3. To get there, we need to make sure the builders in the ecosystem have access to the talent, distribution, and partners they need to succeed. 

  2. **Onboard Talent into Web3.** Crypto offers an opportunity for people around the world to work and earn in global rates, permissionlessly. We want to attract and convince the best talent in the ascending world to work towards a crypto-enabled future.
