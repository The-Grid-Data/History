<h2 id="4-representations-warranties-and-risks">4. Representations, Warranties, and Risks</h2>

<h3 id="41-no-representation-or-warranty">4.1. No Representation or Warranty</h3>

<p>You expressly understand and agree that your use of the Services is at your sole risk. The Services are provided on an âAS ISâ and âAS AVAILABLEâ basis. No advice, information, or statement that we make should be treated as creating any warranty concerning the Services. We do not endorse, guarantee, or assume responsibility for any advertisements, offers, or statements made by third parties concerning the Services.&nbsp;</p>

<p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE MAKE AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, AND WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES AND THE CODE PROPRIETARY OR OPEN SOURCE, WE SPECIFICALLY DO NOT REPRESENT AND WARRANT AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, USAGE, SECURITY, SUITABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR AS TO THE WORKMANSHIP OR TECHNICAL CODING THEREOF, OR THE ABSENCE OF ANY DEFECTS THEREIN, WHETHER LATENT OR PATENT. WE DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES, CODE AND ANY RELATED INFORMATION ARE ACCURATE, COMPLETE, RELIABLE, CURRENT OR ERROR-FREE.</p>

<h3 id="42-disclaimer-of-fiduciary-duties">4.2. Disclaimer of Fiduciary Duties</h3>

<p>To the fullest extent permitted by law and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated herein or applicable provisions of law or equity or otherwise, the parties hereto hereby agree to eliminate any and all fiduciary duties Jet Association may have to the user, its affiliates, or the end users of the Services, the Site or its content.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="43-sophistication-and-risk-of-cryptographic-systems">4.3 Sophistication and Risk of Cryptographic Systems</h3>

<p>By utilizing the Services or interacting with the Site in any way, you represent that you understand the inherent risks associated with cryptographic systems; and warrant that you have an understanding of the usage and intricacies of native cryptographic tokens, like Solana (SOL) and Bitcoin (BTC), smart contract based tokens such as those that follow the Solana SPL standard (https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library), and blockchain-based software systems.</p>

<p>Jet Association does not own or control any of the underlying software through which blockchain networks are formed. In general, the underlying software for blockchain networks tends to be open source such that anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute it. By using the Services, you acknowledge and agree (i) that Jet Association is not responsible for operation of the underlying software and networks that there exists no guarantee of functionality, security, or availability of such software and networks; and (ii) that the underlying protocols are subject to sudden changes in operating rules (known as âForksâ), and that such Forks may materially affect the Services. It might be discretionarily decided not to support (or cease supporting) the Forked network entirely. You acknowledge and agree that Jet Association assumes absolutely no responsibility whatsoever in respect of any underlying software protocols, whether Forked or not.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Underlying networks use public/private key cryptography. You alone are responsible for securing your private key(s). Jet Association does not have access to your private key(s). Losing control of your private key will permanently and irreversibly deny you access to funds on the Solana blockchain or other networks. Neither Jet Association nor any other person will be able to retrieve or protect your funds. Once your private key(s) is lost, you will not be able to transfer your digital assets to any other address or wallet. If this occurs, you will not be able to realize any value or utility that you may hold now or in future. You acknowledge that we do not have any information regarding your wallet or private key(s). We are not responsible for any activities you engage in when using the Services.</p>

<h3 id="44-risk-of-regulatory-actions-in-one-or-more-jurisdictions">4.4 Risk of Regulatory Actions in One or More Jurisdictions</h3>

<p>The Services, digital assets and SOL could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory action, which could impede or limit the ability of Jet Association to continue to develop, or which could impede or limit your ability to access or use the Services or Solana blockchain, including access to your Digital Assets or other funds.</p>

<h3 id="45-risk-of-weaknesses-or-exploits-in-the-field-of-cryptography">4.5 Risk of Weaknesses or Exploits in the Field of Cryptography</h3>

<p>You acknowledge and understand that cryptography is a progressing field. Advances in code cracking or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers may present risks to cryptocurrencies, digital assets and the Services, which could result in the theft or loss of your digital assets or property. To the extent possible, it is intended to update the protocol underlying the Services to account for any advances in cryptography and to incorporate additional security measures, but does not guarantee or otherwise represent full security of the system. By using the Services or accessing the Site, you acknowledge these inherent risks.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="46-volatility-of-cryptocurrency">4.6 Volatility of Cryptocurrency</h3>

<p>You understand that Solana and other blockchain technologies and associated digital assets, currencies or tokens are highly volatile due to many factors including but not limited to adoption, speculation, technology and security risks. You also acknowledge that the cost of transacting on such technologies is variable and may increase at any time causing impact to any activities taking place on the Solana blockchain. You acknowledge these risks and represent that Jet Association cannot be held liable for such fluctuations or increased costs.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="47-application-security">4.7 Application Security</h3>

<p>You acknowledge that the Services are subject to flaws and acknowledge that you are solely responsible for evaluating any code provided by the Services or Site. This warning and others provided in this Agreement by Jet Association in no way evidence or represent an ongoing duty to alert you to all of the potential risks of utilizing the Services or accessing the Site.</p>

<h3 id="48-site-accuracy">4.8 Site Accuracy</h3>

<p>Although it is intended to provide accurate and timely information on the Site, the Site or relevant tools may not always be entirely accurate, complete or current and may also include technical inaccuracies or typographical errors. In an effort to continue to provide you with as complete and accurate information as possible, information may be changed or updated from time to time without notice, including, without limitation, information regarding our policies. Accordingly, you should verify all information before relying on it, and all decisions based on information contained on the Site or relevant tools are your sole responsibility and Jet Association shall have no liability for such decisions. Links to third-party materials (including, without limitation, websites or apps) may be provided as a convenience but are not controlled by any entity. You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for any aspect of the information, content, or services contained in any third-party materials or on any third-party sites accessible or linked to the Site or available via other relevant tools.&nbsp;</p>

<p>No representation is made as to the accuracy, completeness or appropriateness for any particular purpose of any pricing information distributed via the Site. Prices and pricing information may be higher or lower than prices available on other platforms.</p>

<h3 id="49-technical-knowledge">4.9 Technical Knowledge</h3>

<p>Any use or interaction with the Services requires a comprehensive understanding of applied cryptography and computer science in order to appreciate the inherent risks, including those listed above. You represent and warrant that you possess relevant knowledge and skills. Any reference to a type of digital asset on the Site does not indicate our approval or disapproval of the underlying technology regarding such type of digital asset, and should not be used as a substitute for your own understanding of the risks specific to each type of digital asset. We make no warranty as to the suitability of the digital assets referenced on the Site and assume no fiduciary duty in our relations with you.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="410-financial-risks">4.10 Financial Risks</h3>

<p>Use of the Services, in particular for trading digital assets, may carry financial risk. Digital Assets are, by their nature, highly experimental, risky, volatile and transactions carried through the Services are irreversible, final and there are no refunds. You acknowledge and agree that you will access and use the Site and the Services at your own risk. The risk of loss in trading digital assets can be substantial. You should, therefore, carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for you in light of your circumstances and financial resources. By using the Services, you represent that you have been, are and will be solely responsible for making your own independent appraisal and investigations into the risks of a given transaction and the underlying digital assets. You represent that you have sufficient knowledge, market sophistication, professional advice and experience to make your own evaluation of the merits and risks of any transaction conducted via the Services or any underlying Digital Asset. You accept all consequences of using the Services, including the risk that you may lose access to your digital assets indefinitely. All transaction decisions are made solely by you. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, we accept no responsibility whatsoever for, and will in no circumstances be, liable to you in connection with the use of the Services for performing digital asset transactions. Under no circumstances will the operation of all or any portion of the Site or the Services be deemed to create a relationship that includes the provision or tendering of investment advice.</p>

<h3 id="411-applicable-law-and-tax">4.11 Applicable Law and Tax</h3>

<p>You are responsible for complying with applicable law. You agree that we are not responsible for determining whether or which laws may apply to your use of Services, including tax laws. You are solely responsible for reporting and paying any taxes arising from your use of the Site and Services.</p>

<p>Jet Association must comply with applicable law. Applicable law, regulation, and executive orders may require us to, upon request by government agencies, take certain actions or provide information.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="412-operational-risks">4.12 Operational Risks</h3>

<p>You are aware of and accept the risk of operational challenges. The Site may experience sophisticated cyber-attacks, unexpected surges in activity or other operational or technical difficulties that may cause interruptions to or delays on the Site. You agree to accept the risk of the Services failure resulting from unanticipated or heightened technical difficulties, including those resulting from sophisticated attacks, and you agree not to hold us accountable for any related losses. We will not bear any liability, whatsoever, for any damage or interruptions caused by any viruses that may affect your computer or other equipment, or any phishing, wash trading, spoofing or other attack. We advise the regular use of a reputable and readily available virus screening and prevention software. We do not guarantee that the Site is or will remain updated, complete, correct or secure, or that access to the Site will be uninterrupted.
