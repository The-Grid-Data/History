We are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. Please read this carefully as this Privacy Policy is legally binding when you use the Services (as defined in the Terms of Service). As used in this Privacy Policy, âJet Associationâ, âweâ, âusâ or âourâ refers to Jet Association, a non-profit formed and registered in Switzerland.

<ol>
  <li><strong>How We Use Your Information:</strong></li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Use of Cookies and Similar Technologies. The Services do not currently use cookies. The third-party vendors we rely on for services do use cookies. Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer by websites that you visit. They are widely used in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site. Information collected from cookies is used by us to evaluate the effectiveness of our Services and analyze trends, or by vendors we use and rely on. The information collected from cookies allows us to determine such things as which parts of the Site are most visited and difficulties our visitors may experience in accessing the Site or Services. With this knowledge, we can improve the quality of your experience with the Services by recognizing and delivering more of the most desired features and information, as well as by resolving access difficulties.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>We use third party service providers to assist us in better understanding the use of our Services. Our service providers will place cookies in (or use similar technologies) and will receive information that we select that will educate us on such things as how visitors navigate around our Site. This information is aggregated to provide statistical data about our usersâ browsing actions and patterns, and does not personally identify individuals (however, see below information on Solana wallet addresses). This information may include:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>Computer or mobile device information,</li>
  <li>Web Services usage information, such as:</li>
  <li>Page views,</li>
  <li>Account changes (i.e. connecting a wallet) Button clicks,</li>
  <li>Input form changes,</li>
  <li>Errors.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our service providers analyze this information and provide us with aggregate reports. The information and analysis provided by our service providers will be used to assist us in better understanding our visitorsâ interests in our Site and Services and how to better serve those interests, as well as help ensure secure use of the Services for all users. If you want to avoid using cookies altogether, you can disable cookies in your browser. However, disabling cookies might make it difficult or impossible for you to use certain features of the Site or Services. Your use of the Site or Services with a browser that is configured to accept cookies constitutes acceptance of our and third-party cookies.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Public Solana Addresses and Email Addresses. We use and collect public Solana addresses and email addresses to identify and document a userâs journey through our products and historical use of the Site and Services, as defined in the Terms of Service. We may group and analyze these user journeys and historical usage collectively in order to improve our Services and the user experience. We may also use this data to facilitate individual access to the Site, Services, and linked third party websites, communicate with individuals regarding their use of the Services, and in other ways related to individual use of the Services and the Site. The legal basis for this processing is that it is necessary to fulfill a contract with you, as well as our legitimate interests, such as monitoring and improving the Site and Services, and the proper protection of the Site and Services against risks.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Geolocation Data and Telephone Numbers. We use and collect the geolocation data and telephone numbers of our Site visitors. The geolocation data is solely used for regional verification. Due to regulatory restrictions, only users in authorized regions are able to access the Services. Telephone numbers are used for security purposes to validate our users. Users will receive a secure access code via SMS (separate rates may apply from your carrier).</strong>&nbsp;</p>

</ul>

<ol>
  <li><strong>How We Share Your Information:</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Except as set forth below, we do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to third parties our usersâ personal data unless we receive their consent. That being said, in the following situations, we may share personal data with outside parties:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Subsidiaries, Service Consultants and Service Providers. We may share personal data with our subsidiaries, third party consultants and service providers (such as providers of hosting, support, returns, maintenance, and remedial and repair services) to the extent that they require access to our databases, or the information contained in our databases, to service us and the Site;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Merger or Acquisition. We share personal data in connection with, or during negotiations of, any proposed or actual merger, purchase, sale or any other type of acquisition or business combination of all or any portion of our assets, or transfer of all or a portion of our business to another business.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enforcement of Rights/Security. We reserve the right to release personal data (i) when we are under legal compulsion to do so (e.g. we have received a subpoena) or we otherwise believe that the law requires us to do so, (ii) when we believe it is necessary to protect and/or enforce the rights, property interests, or our safety, the safety of our users, or the safety of others (including minors), or (iii) as we deem necessary to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, prevent fraud and otherwise enforce the Privacy Policy and other service agreements;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As Otherwise Allowed by Law. We may transfer personal data to third-parties where we are expressly authorized by applicable law to do so;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Aggregated Information. We may aggregate information that you provide with information provided by other individuals in such a manner that the information is not personally identifiable to you, and we may transfer that aggregated information to third-parties; and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With your express consent.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Data security</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>We use appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your personal data. Our security measures are continuously improved in line with technical developments.</p>

<p>Please note that any data transmission on the Internet (e.g. communication by email) is generally not secure and we accept no liability for data transmitted to us via the Internet. Unfortunately, absolute protection is not technically possible. This information does not apply to the websites of third parties and the corresponding links given on the Site. We assume no responsibility and liability for these.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Duration of data processing</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>We will process your personal data only for the period necessary to achieve the purpose of the processing, or as required by applicable laws.&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Amendments to this Policy</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amended version on the Site including the effective date of the amended version. The current version of the Privacy Policy, as published on the Site, is applicable.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Conflict or Inconsistency</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this Privacy Policy and any non-English language translation thereof, the terms and provisions of this Privacy Policy shall control.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>International transfers</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>In order to communicate with you, the information that we collect from you may be transferred to, stored, used and processed by Jet Association in the United States or one of our service providers based in the United States or outside of the United States.&nbsp; Such entities may be engaged in, among other things, the provision of support services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you are visiting from the European Union or other regions with laws governing information collection and use that may differ from United States law, please note that you are transferring your personal data to the United States. The laws of some countries may not provide the same levels of protection of personal data as your home country, particularly if you are resident in the European Union.&nbsp; By submitting information, you agree to the collection, transfer, storage, use and processing of information about you for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; When you provide personal data to us or our service providers or vendors, you consent to the processing of your information in the United States as we are doing business in the United States.&nbsp; We will take reasonable steps to ensure that information about you is treated securely in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and that all information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers or those of our service providers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES TREAT YOUR INFORMATION IN A MANNER THAT MAY BE SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM, AND LESS PROTECTIVE THAN, THE TREATMENT REQUIRED UNDER THE LAWS OF OTHER COUNTRIES AND JURISDICTIONS. IF YOU DO NOT WANT YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED TO THE UNITED STATES, YOU SHOULD NOT SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH US, OR MAKE USE OF THE SITE.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY THE LAW OF THE COUNTRY IN WHICH YOU ARE LOCATED, YOU EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT YOU MAY HAVE TO REQUIRE US TO TREAT YOUR IDENTIFYING INFORMATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF ANY COUNTRY OR JURISIDICTION OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES.&nbsp; HOWEVER, THE FOREGOING WAIVER MAY NOT BE LEGALLY BINDING IN SOME COUNTRIES, SUCH AS THE MEMBER STATES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION.&nbsp; TO THE EXTENT IT IS NOT LEGALLY BINDING IN THE COUNTRY IN WHICH YOU ARE LOCATED, THIS FOREGOING WAIVER DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

<p>We are entitled to transfer your personal data to third parties abroad for the purposes of the data processing and external access by you of services provided by those third parties. As personal data processors, they are obliged to protect data privacy to the same extent as we ourselves. We choose the processors carefully to ensure compliance with applicable laws.</p>
