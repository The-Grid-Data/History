####  Variable Rate

Variable Rate Pooled Lending with a Jet-optimized design

Jetâs original Pooled Lending product empowers users to borrow and lend
assets in in their [Jet Margin Account](https://docs.jetprotocol.io/jet-
protocol/support/app-and-product-terminology/margin-accounting-concepts-and-
terms), using those assets as collateral while utilizing the traditional DeFi
pooled lending approach; in which interest rates are based on utilization of
the pool (total amount borrowed / total pool deposits).

Jet innovations in pooled lending include an especially designed 3-segment
interest rate curve that optimizes rates and the spread between borrowing and
lending interest rates for users on both sides of the market. [See the
documentation for more information on Jet Pools and Variable Rate
Lending](https://docs.jetprotocol.io/jet-protocol/protocol/jet-
products/pooled-variable-lending-interest-rates-design).

New asset types may be added through the JetDAO governance process and are
proposed and discussed in [the community
forum](https://forum.jetprotocol.io/).
