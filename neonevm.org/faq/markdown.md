###  Popular questions

What is Neon EVM?

Neon EVM is an Ethereum Virtual Machine operating as a smart contract on
Solana. It gives developers the power to directly deploy Ethereum dApps with
no code change, while benefiting from Solana's technical advantages, and is
all built with security, decentralization, and sustainability top of mind.

How do I transfer SPL tokens between Solana and Neon?

[NeonPass](https://neonpass.live/) is an open-source service that facilitates
token transfers between Solana and Neon EVM, including the NEON SPL token. To
use NeonPass, you must have access to two wallets: a Solana wallet, such as
[Phantom](https://phantom.app/), and an EVM wallet, such as
[MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) for Neon.

How can I start building on Neon?

To begin building on Neon, follow our [Quick Start
Guide](https://docs.neonfoundation.io/docs/quick_start). Porting and deploying
your existing EVM contracts onto Neon using Remix or Hardhat is an easy and
seamless process.
