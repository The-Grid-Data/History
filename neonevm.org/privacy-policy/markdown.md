with the third parties. For example, we may share your personal data to the
following categories of recipients as follows:

  * **To our subsidiaries and affiliates** : we may share your personal data with our subsidiaries and affiliates if it necessary to fulfil the purposes of data processing (e.g. by distribution of responsibilities within Neon and its subsidiaries and affiliates in order to provide you the possible service and customer support);

  * **To service providers and suppliers** : we may share your personal data with those who need it to do work for us. Typically, this category of recipients includes independent contractors (e.g. hosting providers, data analytics provides, marketing providers, etc.);
  * **To government authorities** : we may share your personal data with law enforcement agencies, when it needed to comply the law;
  * **Protection and safety** : we may share your personal data with social services (e.g. emergency or rescue service) and government bodies (e.g. courts and police) if it necessary to protect the health and safety of you or other people, our business or to participate in legal or administrative proceedings;
  * **Business Transfers** : we may share your personal data when it is necessary for business transactions, such as a sale or transfer of a business, financing, bankruptcy, or any negotiation of a deal that affects our business (in whole or in part) (**“Business Transactions”**), if the Business Transaction cannot be normally completed without disclosure of personal data;
  * **Blockchain and public display** : we may publicly display your personal data when you make it available through the blockchain or provide it for the purposes, which otherwise requires displaying your personal data on the multiple devices (e.g. when you use our social platforms).

7.2. At your instruction or request and (or) based on your direct consent (if
required) we may share your personal data with another categories of
recipients.

**8\. INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFER**

8.1. **International transfer of personal data**. As a British Virgin Islands
based company we process the personal data, mainly, under the rules and
regulations of the British Virgin Islands. Whenever we transfer personal data
to other jurisdictions, we will ensure that this information is transferred in
accordance with this Policy and as permitted by applicable data protection
laws.

8.2. **Safeguards**. Please be aware, that your personal data may be
stored/transferred outside the jurisdiction in which such personal data was
collected. Unfortunately, not all countries have an adequate level of personal
data protection. In such case we will provide appropriate safeguards for the
personal data transfers, where possible (e.g. by using technical and/or
contractual measures).

8.3. **Derogations in the specific situations**. We may derogate from using of
foregoing safeguards (where permitted by law), especially in the context of
blockchain-based Services including (without limitation) when the data
transfer is required for important reasons of public interest or in the
interest of the data subject, where an applicable contract obligation exists.

**9\. SECURITY MEASURES**

9.1. We take steps to ensure that your information is treated securely. We
protect your information using physical, technical, and administrative
security measures to reduce the risks of loss, unauthorized access and
disclosure, taking into account the nature, scope, context and purpose of the
data processing, and the existing level of risks.

9.2. Unfortunately, we are unable guarantee that your personal data will
always be secure, since almost any system for keeping / transmitting
information can be hacked or may have vulnerabilities. We will notify you and
any applicable regulator of a suspected data security breach where we are
legally required to do so.

**10\. RETENTION OF PERSONAL DATA**

10.1. **In general**. Basically, personal data is stored or otherwise
processed only during that time when there is a business or compliance reason
to do so.

10.2. **Retention Period**. Processing of personal data that Neon collects,
stores or otherwise use will take place during the specific period, during
which there is a need to access such data in order to fulfill one or more
processing purposes (**“Retention Period”**). In our interaction with personal
data, we will use the principle of data minimization, which means that we
strive to (i) minimize the amount of personal data collected; and (ii)
minimize the length of the Retention Period.

10.3. **Length of the Retention Period**. The length of the Retention Period
depends on the purposes of data processing, taking into account the potential
risk of harm from the personal data breach. Thus, we will use your personal
data only as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which the
information is collected, unless the applicable laws require longer length of
the Retention Period. Among other things, this means that we may retain
records of you for a period of time where we have legal grounds, even if you
have ended your interaction with us.

**11\. THIRD PARTIES AND THEIR SERVICES**

11.1. This Website or other Services provided by Neon may refer or contain
links to the third-party services, which includes but not limited to the
websites, plug-ins and applications (“**Third-Party Services** ”).

11.2. Please note that we cannot control Third-Party Services and its methods
and ways of using your personal data, even some our own Services are combined
or intended to be used together with such Third-Party Services. We encourage
you to review relevant third-party privacy notices that govern their
processing of your personal data before any interaction with Third-Party
Services.

**12\. BLOCKCHAIN & PRIVACY**

12.1. In the process of interacting with you, Neon may provide you with
blockchain-based Services or refers to the blockchain-based services owned and
operated by the third parties. In general, Blockchain can be described as a
technology for distributed data storage. This means that the data records in
the blockchain, by the general rule, are (i) immutable; (ii) decentralized
(controlled / stored by many persons); and (iii) publicly available.

12.2. In particular, blockchain has the following impact on your privacy:

  * Immutability: in general, personal data placed in the blockchain cannot be deleted;
  * Decentralization: there is no single person who administer the blockchain data, due to decentralized nature of the blockchain records (blockchain is governed by the multiple voices, not one);
  * Public Availability: blockchain-stored information (including any personal data, if any) can be easily accessed by any interested person.

12.3. Contrary to popular misconception, blockchain transactions, generally,
cannot be described as “anonymous”. Information from the blockchain can be
compared to other publicly / non-publicly information obtained from other
sources. In particular, this may lead to the de-anonymization (disclosure of
personality) and / or disclosure of your financial status and transactions.

12.4. Please do not use blockchain technology if the possible impact on your
privacy does not meet your expectations. If you are unfamiliar with blockchain
technology, we strongly encourage you to do your own research or seek a
professional advice on how the blockchain may impact on your privacy.

**13\. YOUR RIGHTS**

13.1. **Rights you may enjoy.** Depending on the jurisdiction, in which you
reside and (or) we provide Services, you may have certain rights regarding the
control of your privacy. For example, GDPR and similar laws provide you the
following rights:

  * **Access** : the right to require us provide you with confirmation of data processing activity, a copy of the personal data processed and supplementary information, such as the terms under which we process your personal data (these terms are already described in this privacy policy);
  * **Rectification** : the right to require us correct incorrect personal data or complete it;
  * **Erasure** (right “to be forgotten”): the right to require us to erase your personal data;
  * **Restriction of processing** : the right to require us to restrict using of your personal data in certain circumstances (when processing is restricting, we, generally, may only store your personal data and will refrain from most other processing activities);
  * **Data portability** : the right to require use to provide you with a copy of your personal data in structured, commonly used and machine-readable format;
  * **Object** : the right to object to the processing of their personal data in certain circumstances (have an absolute right to stop direct marketing communications with you, or, in certain circumstances, may object against processing, which is based on legitimate interests);
  * **Withdrawal** : the right to withdraw your consent to the processing of personal data (this will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal).

13.2. We will not use any automated individual decision-making (i.e. a
decision making process, which used solely automated means without any human
involvement), including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning
your rights or which may significantly affect you, unless:

  * it is necessary for the entry into or performance of a contract;
  * it is authorized by the applicable laws;
  * it is based on the individual’s explicit consent.

13.3. We will be happy if you contact us and we will consider the opportunity
to help you exercise your rights. Please note that, in general, these rights
are not absolute and requests to exercise them may be denied in certain
circumstances.

**14\. RIGHT TO LODGE A COMPLAINT**

14.1. If you believe that we are violating your privacy rights or handling
your personal data inappropriately, you have the right to file a complaint
with your national data protection authority (**“Data Protection Authority”**)
or bring a suit in the court. We would be happy if you contact us before doing
this so that we can take steps to resolve your problem or clear your doubts
regarding your personal data treatment.
