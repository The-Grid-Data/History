_Proceeds will be used to hire for development, marketing, compliance, and
admin, obtain licenses in various jurisdictions, and open offices in relevant
locations._

MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA, October 24, 2023 -- Cube.Exchange, a soon-to-launch
digital asset trading platform, announced today that it has raised $9 million
dollars in seed funding that includes a cross-section of global firms involved
in the Web3 space.

Investors in the fundraise include but are not limited to Asymmetric
Technologies, Susquehanna Private Equity Investments, LLLP, Everstake,
Foundation Capital, Big Brain Holdings, Third Kind Venture Capital, Arche
Fund, WWVentures, members of the Cube.Exchange management team, and others. As
part of this investment, many of the named firms will become strategic
partners heading into the launch and beyond.

> “This fundraise shows that there is broad support in the industry for what
> we are building here at Cube,” said CEO Bartosz Lipiński. “The partners we
> have lined up speak to the strength of our team and our vision, and we can’t
> wait to bring it to market later this year.”

The proceeds from the fundraise will be used to expand the team across
development, marketing, compliance and administrative roles, as well as to
obtain licenses in various jurisdictions and also to open new offices in
strategically relevant locations.

Cube.Exchange aims to solve the problem of founder risk by creating a unique
hybrid market structure that takes advantage of the benefits of both
traditional exchanges and the efficiencies offered by embracing certain
elements of Web3 technology. This is designed to ensure that assets remain
under the ownership of users and are never subject to co-mingling, re-
hypothecation, misappropriation, or other illicit use by exchange founders or
team members.

The exchange has paired a number of innovations, including an off-chain
sequencer with an industry-leading lightning-fast matching engine, on-chain
settlement, and a unique multi-party computation (MPC) wallet to ensure that
only those parties authorized by a user have access to their funds. This
market structure is an industry first and has been built from the ground-up to
realize the true promise of efficient, trustless asset trading and ownership.
Your keys, your trades, your assets - even in the event of bankruptcy or
insolvency.

> “Bartosz and his team are building an exchange that we believe solves for
> many of the problems currently plaguing the digital asset industry,” said
> Joe McCann, CEO at Asymmetric Technologies. “The days of assets disappearing
> overnight for many as a result of the actions of a few will soon be over,
> and we couldn’t be more excited to be part of the solution.”

The platform is currently in early access and being tested by market makers,
professional traders, and others while the waitlist swells with interest.

Cube.Exchange will initially launch as a spot exchange before expanding to
additional offerings next year. More details will be shared in the not-too-
distant future.
