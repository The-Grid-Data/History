This can occur, for example, when the market reaches a daily price fluctuation limit or there is insufficient liquidity in the market.</li><li>Placing contingent orders, such as “stop-loss” or “stop-limit” orders, will not necessarily limit your losses to the intended amounts, since market conditions may make it impossible to execute such orders.</li><li>All Digital Asset positions involve risk, and a “spread” position may not be less risky than an outright “long” or “short” position.</li><li>ALL THE POINTS NOTED ABOVE APPLY TO ALL DIGITAL ASSET PAIR TRADING. THIS BRIEF STATEMENT CANNOT DISCLOSE ALL THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE TRADES.</li><li>You agree that there may be operational issues, human error, malicious conduct (such as fraud or cyber-attack) and other risks associated with the transmission of Digital Assets, which may delay, prevent, misdirect, or otherwise frustrate your ability to withdraw your Digital Assets, or impact the Services, the Site, the Cube App or the Guardian Network.</li><li>You agree that your Digital Assets are not deposited in your Cube Client Account or with Cube, and that neither Cube or the Guardian Network is responsible for any actions by you or third parties that delay, prevent, misdirect, or otherwise frustrate the deposit, withdraw, or transfer of Digital Assets from your MPC Vault, or for any losses or fees resulting therefrom.
