You must provide any information requested when creating a Cube Client Account or when prompted by any screen displayed within the Services. You represent and warrant that any information you provide via the Services is accurate and complete. To interact with the Cube.Exchange, this will require you to sign-in with an OAuth provider.</li></ol><p></p><ol><li>You authorize us to make inquiries, whether directly or through third parties, that we consider necessary to verify your identity or protect you and/or us against fraud or other financial crime, and to take action we reasonably deem necessary based on the results of such inquiries. When we carry out these inquiries, you acknowledge and agree that your personal information may be disclosed to credit reference and fraud prevention or financial crime agencies and that these agencies may respond to our inquiries in full.</li></ol><p></p><ol><li>When you create a Cube Client Account, you agree to: (i) utilize OAuth for login purposes; (ii) provide accurate and truthful information; (iii) maintain and promptly update your Cube Client Account information; (iv) maintain the security of your Cube Client Account by restricting access to your Cube Client Account; (v) promptly notify us if you discover or otherwise suspect any security breaches related to your Cube Client Account; and (vi) take responsibility for all activities that occur under your Cube Client Account and accept all risks of any authorized or unauthorized access to your Cube Client Account, to the maximum extent permitted by law. Cube may, in its sole discretion, limit the number of Cube Client Accounts that you may hold, maintain, or acquire on our Services.</li></ol><p></p><ol><li>You agree and acknowledge that you are solely responsible for securing access to the account managed by your OAuth provider. If you lose access to this account, we orCube.Exchange currently cannot assist you with any recovery and you must contact your OAuth provider.</li></ol><p></p><ol><li>If you lose access to your Cube Client Account and cannot recover it yourself, you may contact Cube.Exchange’s customer support to see if they can assist in its recovery, but you agree and acknowledge that: (i) Cube is not guaranteeing that it can recover any lost access to your Cube Client Account and (ii) any changes in or loss of Digital Assets in your MPC Vault related to the loss of your password or access to your Cube Client Account or unauthorized access to your account are your sole responsibility and neither Cube nor the Guardian Network is liable for such changes or loss.</li></ol><p><br></p><ol><li><strong>MPC Vault and Wallet Creation</strong><br></li><li>Once your Cube Client Account has been approved and created, you may initiate the creation of each of your MPC Vault through a distributed key share generation process among you, Cube and the Guardian Network. Each non-custodial MPC Wallet within your MPC Vault created by you places your Digital Assets in your care, custody and control.</li></ol><p></p><ol><li>When your MPC Vault is created, a PDF document of your Key Share will be generated and provided to you. It is your responsibility to save your Key Share in a secure manner.</li></ol><p></p><ol><li>The purpose of your Key Share is to allow you to request a withdrawal of assets directly with the Guardian Network ifCube.Exchange’s settlement layer has not processed a settlement for more than 48 hours. The Guardian Network would operate the withdrawal function in place of Cube.Exchange. This function is currently under design.</li></ol><p></p><ol><li>You are sole owner of and fully responsible for all activity that occurs under your MPC Vault and MPC Wallets. Cube.Exchange, in its sole discretion, may refuse to open a Cube Client Account. As further described in Section 8c, Cube.Exchange, in its sole discretion, may also suspend or terminate the exercise of its Key Share related to any MPC Vault or Wallets, and/or suspend or terminate the trading of any Digital Assets from your MPC Vault or any of your MPC Wallets if it is unable to do so or if it identifies a sanction violation, illicit activity, or some other compliance-related issue.</li></ol><p></p><ol><li>In order to complete an offer, bid, order, trade or transaction via the Services, you must first load Digital Assets to your MPC Wallet. You may be charged fees by the External Provider you use to transmit Digital Assets to or from your MPC Wallet. Cube is not responsible for any External Provider fees or for the management and security of any External Account. You are solely responsible for your use of any External Provider, and you agree to comply with all terms and conditions applicable to any External Provider. The timing associated with a load transaction will depend in part upon the performance of third parties responsible for maintaining the applicable External Provider, and Cube makes no guarantee regarding the amount of time it may take to load Digital Assets into your MPC Wallet.</li></ol><p></p><ol><li>In some cases, the External Provider may reject your Digital Assets or may otherwise be unavailable to receive your Digital Assets. You agree that you will not hold Cube liable for any damages resulting from such rejected transactions.</li></ol><p></p><ol><li>Before you are permitted to deposit any Digital Assets within your MPC Vault, you must successfully complete Cube’s know-your-customer (KYC)/anti-money laundering (AML) onboarding diligence and other processes, which may vary by jurisdiction.</li></ol><p><br></p><ol><li><strong>Orders, Trades, CubeNet Recordation and Net Settlement</strong><br></li><li>To place an order on Cube.Exchange, you first must authenticate yourself to Cube.Exchange by logging into your Cube Client Account. You then place the order via the Services on Cube.Exchange. The Digital Assets in your MPC Vault remain in your MPC Vault and are not placed with Cube.Exchange in order to place an order, match a transaction, or settle an order. Cube.Exchange does not touch your Digital Assets and those assets are never transferred to any sort of omnibus wallet controlled by Cube.Exchange or Cube.</li></ol><p></p><ol><li>When you submit a new order via the Services, you authorize Cube.Exchange to execute a transaction in accordance with such order on a spot basis and charge you any applicable Fees as set forth in our current Fee Schedule.</li></ol><p></p><ol><li>You acknowledge and agree that: (i) Cube is not acting as your broker, intermediary, agent, or advisor or in any fiduciary capacity, (ii) no communication or information provided to you by Cube shall be considered or construed as investment, tax, or any other form of advice, (iii) any information provided by Cube to you is given strictly for educational purposes and designed to provide information about prices, ranges and volatility of Digital Assets, and (iv) Cube does not market, promote or offer any product to you or any third party through its Services.</li></ol><p></p><ol><li>If you select a market trade,Cube.Exchange will attempt, on a commercially reasonable basis, to execute the trade on or close to the prevailing market exchange rate onCube.Exchange via the Services. You acknowledge and agree that the exchange rate information made available via our Services may differ from prevailing exchange rates made available via other sources outside of the Services.</li></ol><p></p><ol><li>All prices on Cube.Exchange reflect the price applicable to the purchase or sale of Digital Assets in your order. All Digital Asset sales and purchases on Cube.Exchange are subject to availability. We reserve the right to cancel or discontinue any sale or purchase of any Digital Assets with or without notice.</li></ol><p></p><ol><li>Once Cube.Exchange’s matching engine executes your order, the matched transaction will be recorded on CubeNet, and a confirmation will be electronically made available to you via the Services detailing the particulars of the trade. You acknowledge and agree that the failure of the Services to provide such confirmation shall not prejudice or invalidate the terms of such trade.</li></ol><p></p><ol><li>All sales and purchases of Digital Assets via the Services are final. We do not accept any returns or provide refunds for your purchase of Digital Assets.</li></ol><p><br></p><ol><li><strong>Lost or Stolen Key</strong><br></li><li>If you lose your Key Share or your Key Share is stolen for your MPC Vault (the “Impacted Vault”), you can informCube.Exchange by contacting customer support. Neither Cube nor Cube.Exchange stores your Key Share and cannot provide it to you if lost or stolen.</li></ol><p></p><ol><li>If possible, Cube.Exchange will freeze the Impacted Vault by:</li></ol><p></p><ol><li>refusing to exercise its Key Share for the Impacted Vault for any Net Settlements or withdrawals; and</li></ol><p></p><ol><li>publishing to the Guardian Network that the Impacted Vault exists so that they will also refuse to exercise the Guardian Network’s Key Share for the Impact Vault for any Net Settlements or withdrawals.</li></ol><p></p><ol><li>Cube.Exchange is currently working on a process that will permit you to recover your lost or stolen Key Share for your Impacted Vault. To do so, Cube.Exchange will require you to go through similar KYC identity verification processes that you did when creating your Cube Client Account. Assuming a positive verification, a new Key Share for you will be generated through action of the Guardians and Cube.Exchange together.</li></ol><p></p><ol><li>You agree and acknowledge that in the event that any Digital Assets are transferred, stolen or otherwise missing from your Impacted Digital Vault, you are solely responsible for the loss of such Digital Assets.</li></ol><p><br></p><ol><li><strong>User Notice of Withdrawals from MPC Wallet</strong><br></li><li>You may activate a withdrawal from your MPC Vault by logging onto Cube.Exchange and sending Cube a notice indicating the amount of Digital Assets that you intend to withdraw from your MPC Vault. After Cube reviews your unmatched and matched but unsettled order amounts on Cube.Exchange, if your MPC Vault holds sufficient Digital Assets to cover the notified withdrawal amount, Cube.Exchange will exercise its Key Share to verify the withdrawal amount and your withdrawal will proceed. A withdrawal notice may usually take up to 24 hours.</li></ol><p></p><ol><li>Cube.Exchange is currently working on a process that will permit you to send a notice of your intent to withdraw assets from your MPC Vault using your Key Share to the Guardian Network ifCube.Exchange’s settlement layer has not processed a net settlement for more than 48 hours. In that case, the Guardian Network would operate Cube’s function described in Section 8a above in place of Cube.</li></ol><p></p><ol><li>Notwithstanding the preceding clauses or any other provision within these Terms, Cube reserves the right to take actions in the event of identified illicit activity associated with your Cube Client Account. These illicit activities may include but are not limited to sanctions violations, exposure to high-risk wallets, or involvement with wallets previously flagged for terrorist or illegal financing. Additionally, Cube may take action when it deems an activity to be beyond its acceptable risk tolerance level. Depending upon the illicit activity involved, Cube’s actions in response may include, among other things, not permitting the user to place new orders onCube.Exchange, suspending or cancelling the user’s Cube Client Account, a report to relevant authorities, and/or not responding to a user’s notification of withdraw, which would result in the user’s Digital Assets being locked in its MPC Vault until further resolution.

You should, therefore, carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for you in light of your circumstances and financial resources, and you should know the following points:</p><p><br></p><ol><li>You may sustain a total loss of the Digital Assets in your MPC Vault. You acknowledge and agree that your access to and use of the Services, including conducting trades, is at your own risk, and that Cube is not liable to you for any losses you incur arising from such risks.</li></ol><p></p><ol><li>There is no established procedure for establishing the value of Digital Assets. The methodology for valuing Digital Assets is nascent, and there may be disagreement amongst investors, some of whom may argue that Digital Assets have no value. You should ensure that you fully understand the characteristics of any particular Digital Asset before investing.</li></ol><p></p><ol><li>The character of Digital Assets is such that it may lead to an increased risk of financial crime.</li></ol><p></p><ol><li>Digital Assets are not legal tender and are not backed by any government.</li></ol><p></p><ol><li>Markets for Digital Assets can at times become what is known as “illiquid,” which means there can be a scarcity of persons who are willing to trade at any one time. Under certain market conditions, you may find it difficult or impossible to liquidate a position. This can occur, for example, when the market reaches a daily price fluctuation limit or there is insufficient liquidity in the market.</li></ol><p></p><ol><li>Placing contingent orders, such as “stop-loss” or “stop-limit” orders, will not necessarily limit your losses to the intended amounts, since market conditions may make it impossible to execute such orders.</li></ol><p></p><ol><li>All Digital Asset positions involve risk, and a “spread” position may not be less risky than an outright “long” or “short” position.</li></ol><p></p><ol><li>You agree that there may be operational issues, human error, malicious conduct (such as fraud or cyber-attack) and other risks associated with the transmission of Digital Assets, which may delay, prevent, misdirect, or otherwise frustrate your ability to withdraw your Digital Assets, or impact the Services or the Guardian Network.</li></ol><p></p><ol><li>You agree that your Digital Assets are not deposited in your Cube Client Account or with Cube, and that neither Cube nor the Guardian Network is responsible for any actions by you or third parties that delay, prevent, misdirect, or otherwise frustrate the deposit, withdraw, or transfer of Digital Assets from your MPC Vault, or for any losses or fees resulting therefrom. You further agree that neither Cube nor the Guardian Network is obligated to assist or support you in any fashion with any unsuccessful transmission of Digital Assets.</li></ol><p></p><ol><li>We do not own or control the underlying software protocols of Digital Asset networks that govern the operation of Digital Assets. In general, the underlying protocols are open source, and anyone can use, copy, modify or distribute them. We are not responsible for the operation of the underlying network protocols, and we make no guarantees regarding their security, functionality or availability. Given Cube’s lack of control of underlying software protocols, several risks may arise, including: (i) distributed denial of service; (ii) sybil attacks; (iii) phishing; (iv) social engineering; (v) hacking; (vi) smurfing; (vii) malware; (viii) double spending; (ix) majority-mining, consensus-based or other mining attacks; (x) misinformation campaigns; (xi) forks; and (xii) spoofing.</li></ol><p></p><ol><li>All blockchain transactions include data, and in some circumstances, may include personal data about you. Many blockchain technologies store transaction data publicly and permanently. When you use such technology, you are intentionally making that transaction data public and acknowledge that the data cannot be deleted, removed, or reversed due to the nature of blockchain technology.</li></ol><p></p><ol><li>The Services user interface may display incorrect information or information that differs from our internal books and records. In the event of any conflict, the contents of our internal books and records shall prevail.</li></ol><p></p><ol><li>You acknowledge and agree that you shall access and use the Services at your own risk, including but not limited to the risks described in this Section 12 and the remainder of these Terms.</li></ol><p></p><ol><li>The legality of Digital Assets or trading of them for oneself or on behalf of others may not be clear and may vary under the laws of different jurisdictions throughout the world. This can mean that the legality of holding or trading Digital Assets or engaging in the foregoing on behalf of others is not always clear. Whether and on what basis a Digital Asset may constitute property, an asset, might vary from one jurisdiction to another. You are responsible for knowing and understanding how the laws applicable to you or your property address, limit, regulate, and tax the Digital Assets you trade. Similarly, changes in relevant laws, regulations, policies, and rules may cause abnormal fluctuations in prices and other areas, which may cause you to suffer losses.</li></ol><p></p><ol><li>Taxes may be payable on any return and/or on any increase in the value of your Digital Assets and you should seek independent advice on your tax obligations. Cube is not responsible for any violation made by you due to your obligation to calculate and pay taxes and duties.</li></ol><p></p><ol><li>Transactions in Digital Assets may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable. Some Digital Assets transactions shall be deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that you initiate the transaction.</li></ol><p></p><ol><li>Cube does not provide any financial, investment or legal advice in connection with the Services provided by Cube. While our products and services may involve the use of various Digital Assets, it is essential to understand that Cube does not endorse, promote, or provide any investment advice or recommendation regarding these Digital Assets. The inclusion of any one specific Digital Asset within our Service should not be construed as an endorsement or validation of its value, utility, or potential investment merit. You are solely responsible for conducting your own research and making informed decisions concerning the use and involvement of Digital Assets. Cube disclaims any association, sponsorship, or endorsement of any particular Digital Asset, and we encourage you to exercise caution and diligence when dealing with Digital Assets within the scope of our Services.</li></ol><p></p><ol><li>Any account maintained by Cube for your benefit may not be sufficient to cover all losses incurred by you. There may be additional risks, which have not been foreseen or identified in these current Terms. Carefully assess whether your financial situation and tolerance for risk is suitable for buying, selling, or trading Digital Assets.</li></ol><p><br></p><p>CUBE IS NOT A BANK OR OTHER DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION. NEITHER YOUR CUBE CLIENT ACCOUNT NOR YOUR MPC VAULT IS A DEPOSIT ACCOUNT OR A BANK ACCOUNT. NEITHER YOUR CUBE CLIENT ACCOUNT NOR MPC VAULT NOR DIGITAL ASSETS ARE COVERED BY INSURANCE AGAINST LOSSES OR THE PROTECTIONS OF ANY COMPARABLE ORGANIZATION ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.</p><p><br></p><p>ALL THE POINTS NOTED ABOVE APPLY TO ALL DIGITAL ASSET TRADING. THIS BRIEF SECTION CANNOT DISCLOSE ALL THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE TRADES.</p><p><br></p><ol><li><strong>Fees</strong></li></ol><p><br></p><ol><li>You agree to pay Cube.Exchange the fees for all Bona Fide Matched Transactions completed via our Services (“Fees”) as made available via the Fee Schedule, which we may change from time to time. Changes to the Fee Schedule are effective as of the effective date indicated in the posting of the revised Fee Schedule to the Services and will apply prospectively to any Digital Asset trades or transactions that take place following the effective date of such revised Fee Schedule.</li></ol><p></p><ol><li>In addition to the Fees, your External Provider may impose fees. Any fees imposed by your External Provider will not be reflected on the transaction screens or in notices to you containing information regarding applicable Fees imposed by Cube. You are solely responsible for paying any fees imposed by an External Provider.</li></ol><p></p><ol><li>You authorize us, or our designated payment processor, to charge you for any applicable Fees owed in connection with trades, transactions, and actions you complete via the Services, which will be reflected in each Net Settlement.</li></ol><p><br></p><ol><li><strong>Account Security</strong></li></ol><p><br></p><ol><li>You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized access to or use of your Cube Client Account username or any other breach of security. You also agree to ensure that you exit from your Cube Client Account at the end of each session. You should use particular caution when accessing your account from a public or shared computer so that others are not able to view or record your password or other personal information.</li></ol><p></p><ol><li>We have the right to disable any Cube Client Account username, password, or other identifier, whether chosen by you or provided by us, at any time in our sole discretion for any or no reason, including if, in our opinion, you have violated any provision of these Terms.</li></ol><p><br></p><ol><li><strong>Acceptable Use</strong></li></ol><p><br></p><ol><li>You may use the Services, including the Site and Cube App, your Cube Client Account, your MPC Vault, and the Guardian Network only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms.
