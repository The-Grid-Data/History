# Cube Exchange Fee Schedule

Effective as of January 15th, 2024

**Trading**

Cube Exchange implements trading fees determined by a proportion of the order
size and trade side: maker or taker. Fees are paid in the receiving asset,
recorded on CubeNet when your trade is matched, and automatically deducted
from your MPC Vault at the time of net settlement of your match trade.  
  
Fees are **6 bps**(0.06%) on maker trades and **12 bps**(0.12%) on taker
trades.  
  
Resting orders that provide liquidity on the order book are maker trades,
while orders that take liquidity are taker. Limit orders priced beyond the
current best bid or ask prices will rest on the orderbook. If eventually
executed, these are maker trades. ‘Post Only’ order ensures you are always on
the maker's side of the trade. Market orders, which accept the best available
bid or ask price on a paid, is on the taker side. Market crossing limit
orders, are also taker trades.  
  
For example:

Trader A places a limit order selling 100 SOL priced at $100 USDC/SOL.  
Trader B places a market order, which lifts trader A’s offer.

Trader A, as the maker, will pay a 0.06% fee on the received $10,000 USDC,
total: 6 USDC

Trader B, as the taker, will pay a 0.12% fee on the received 100 SOL, total:
0.12 SOL

Users pay required blockchain gas fees to deposit into their MPC vault.

Taker Trade| 0.12% (12 basis points)| Charged for orders that take liquidity
away from the market, like market orders or immediate limit orders.  
Deposit| Blockchain network fee (gas fee) | Fee for depositing funds, which is the standard blockchain network fee.  
Withdrawal Confirmations (During Early Access) 0| Free| Withdrawal fees are
currently waived during Cube.Exchange's early access period.  
  
Maker Trades: These are trades where a trader adds liquidity to the market.
Essentially, if you place an order that doesn't immediately match with an
existing order, you're considered a "maker." Your order goes on the order book
and waits for someone else to match it. For example, if you set a limit order
to sell a cryptocurrency at a price higher than the current market price, your
order will wait on the order book until a matching order comes along. Cube
Exchange charges a fee of 0.06% (6 basis points, where 1 basis point is
1/100th of a percent) for maker trades. So, if you sell $10,000 worth of
cryptocurrency, you'll pay a fee of $6.

Taker Trades: These occur when a trader takes liquidity away from the market.
If you place an order that is immediately matched with an existing order,
you're a "taker." This includes market orders, where you accept the best
available current price, and limit orders that match immediately with existing
orders. The fee for taker trades is 0.12% (12 basis points). For instance, if
you buy 100 units of a cryptocurrency and the total value of your trade is
equivalent to 100 units of that cryptocurrency, you pay a fee of 0.12 units.
