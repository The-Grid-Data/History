# The Metaplex Bug Bounty Program Guidelines

### How to get started with the Metaplex Bounty Program:

  1. Check the _Security Tiering_ and _Out of Scope_ sections below for the programs or domains that are within scope.
  2. Familiarize yourself with the vulnerability types that are out of scope.
  3. Perform your research/testing without impacting other users. (be nice!)
  4. Report your in-scope vulnerability by including written code of the exploit and instructions for reproducing the vulnerability. Submissions without clear reproduction steps may be ineligible for a reward.
  5. During the course of an investigation, it may take time to resolve the issue you have reported. We ask that you refrain from publicly disclosing details regarding an issue youâve reported until the fix has been publicly made available. 
  6. Once Metaplex has reproduced the vulnerability, you will become eligible to receive a reward in most cases.
  7. All reward amounts are determined by the Severity Guidelines and Project/Program tiers.
  8. When duplicates occur, we only award the first report that was received, provided that it can be fully reproduced.
  9. You may publish write-ups about the vulnerability, however you must wait to publish**** until a fix has been confirmed by the Metaplex team. If you publish before a fix is confirmed you will be ineligible for a reward.

### Rewards

#### Security Tier

#### Tier 1

#### Tier 2

#### Tier 3

#### Critical

  * $50k - $200k+

  * $25k - $100k+

  * $5k - $20k

#### High

  * $20k - $50k

  * $10k - $20k

  * $2k - $5k

#### Medium

  * $4k - $20k

  * $4k - $10k

  * $1k - $2k

#### Low

  * $200 - $2k

  * $200 - $2k

  * $200 - $1k

 _Critical issues have a soft cap for the reward amount and will be reviewed
on a case-by-case basis to determine the reward amount._

### Severity Guidelines

**Critical -** Direct and immediate risk to a broad array of users. They often
affect the low-level/foundational components of our application stacks or
infrastructure. e.g.,

  * Loss of funds
  * Arbitrary code execution

**High -** Attackers can read or modify highly sensitive data or behaviors
that they should not be able to access. Generally more narrow scope than
critical issues when judged against broadness of impact or ease of
exploitation. e.g.,

  * Modify sensitive data like Token Metadata or Auction configuration
  * Modify the ownership or permissions of sensitive data

**Medium -** Attackers can read or modify limited amounts of data or behaviors
they are not authorized to access. Generally more narrow scope than high
severity issues when judged against broadness of impact or ease of
exploitation. e.g.,

  * Circumventing the captcha for Candy Machine

**Low -** Attackers can access extremely limited amounts of data or behavior.
They may violate an expectation for how something is intended to work but
allow nearly no escalation of privilege or ability to trigger unintended
behavior by an attacker.

### Current Program Security Tiering (2022/12/19)  

#### Tier 1

  * Token Metadata

#### Tier 2

  * Bubblegum
  *   *   *   * Candy Machine

#### Tier 3

  * Gumdrop
  * 

When categorizing programs or libraries into tiers, the following inputs are
considered:  

  1. The importance of a program to the Metaplex community ecosystem. The more a program is depended upon or used, the more likely a program will be considered in a higher security tier. The Token Metadata Program is an example of a core, widely depended upon program whereas the Gumdrop program would be considered less important.
  2. [The level of stability](https://docs.metaplex.com/stability). The more stable, the more likely a program will be considered in a higher security tier.
  3. The level of audit and review a program has undergone. An example, whether a program has been audited by a third party security professional, or whether the Metaplex DAO has voted the program forward by community governance.  

The Metaplex Program Libraries can be found
[here](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex-program-library). Only
the latest versions of these programs deployed to mainnet are eligible.
