# Scalability War, Data Availability, Account Abstraction: Exploring Crypto‚Äôs
‚ÄúBroadband Moment‚Äù

Charles Guillemet, CTO at Ledger, explores the technical trends that shaped
2023 and outlines his predictions for the year ahead in crypto.

We find ourselves in a pivotal moment in the blockchain revolution, with the
events of 2023, particularly the banking crisis, serving as reminders of the
enduring significance of blockchain technologies‚Äô attributes of
decentralization, self-custody, and transparency.

This article is divided into two sections, each exploring the dynamics of the
blockchain industry and highlighting that we‚Äôre in the midst of crypto‚Äôs
‚Äúbroadband moment.‚Äù In the first section, I highlight 4 technical driving
forces that shaped 2023 and bound to underpin the upcoming months:

  * **Trend #1:** The ongoing battle for protocol scalability. 
  * **Trend #2:** The Data Availability war.
  * **Trend #3:** The rise of Account Abstraction, the next standard for user interaction. 
  * **Trend #4:** The emergence of the Shared Security concept, bound to shape crypto‚Äôs future.
  * **Trend #5:** NFTs, a rapidly changing landscape.

In the second section, I outline my 2024 predictions by answering the
following questions:

  * Which blockchain protocol will prevail in the near future? 
  * Which consumer-facing crypto use cases are to be expected this year?  
  * And in bonus: a few complementary forecasts for 2024 üôÇ 

#### **Part I: What shaped 2023 in the blockchain field?**

##### **Trend#1: The ongoing battle for protocol scalability:**

Our daily Internet applications couldn‚Äôt exist without the exponential
broadband speed reached decades ago. As we examine the evolution of the crypto
landscape throughout 2023, it is clear that we‚Äôre in the midst of a similar
‚Äúbroadband moment‚Äù characterized by a blockchain race for increased
scalability. Let‚Äôs examine how the main blockchain protocols evolved over the
past 12 months.

###### Cosmos ‚Äì leveraging blockchain modularity:

Cosmos is a decentralized network of independent, interoperable blockchains
aiming to solve the scalability and interoperability challenges many
blockchains face. **The foundational principles (and strengths) of Cosmos lie
in modularity, a feature that facilitates the development of dedicated chains
for implementing an application.** At the heart of this feature is the Inter-
Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC), a system that enables communication
and the transfer of assets between different blockchains within the Cosmos
ecosystem, Tendermint, and its associated dPOS.

Several interesting protocols have recently moved to the Cosmos ecosystem,
highlighting the protocol‚Äôs strong vitality. This is exemplified by DyDx‚Äôs
transition from StarkEx to its [dedicated chain dYdX chain in the Cosmos
ecosystem](https://dydx.exchange/blog/dydx-chain). This move is accompanied by
intriguing incentive structures, where trading fees flow to validators through
staking mechanisms. Interestingly, Celestia, a modular data availability
network, also launched on the Cosmos ecosystem.

**I believe this Cosmos modularity narrative could play an important role in
the next cycle,** and that the Cosmos ecosystem could be an interesting setup
for bringing assets and services to the other chains, highlighting the
potential for cross-chain collaboration within this specific blockchain
landscape.

###### Solana ‚Äì the renaissance of a robust Layer-1 network:

Following FTX‚Äôs downfall in November 2022, many commentators declared the
death of Solana. 2023 proved them wrong. Post-FTX, renewed interest in Solana
has been fuelled by fundamental strength, positive technical indicators, and
impressive market performance. Solana‚Äôs recovery is now evident, with a token
price above $100 and a 1000% annual increase. Key elements driving the token‚Äôs
resurgence include significant updates, developer commitment, community
support, and strategic partnerships. The platform‚Äôs breakthroughs in high-
speed blockchain technology, NFTs, DeFi, and Proof of History distinguish it
in the crypto landscape.

As a matter of fact, Solana‚Äôs core value proposition is resolving scalability
challenges through a robust and scalable Layer-1 (L1) solution. **Indeed, one
of the key advantages of the Solana design is that everything happens on
Layer-1 mainnet, which avoids liquidity fragmentation and complex bridging
problems.** This is achieved with faster consensus but heavier validation
requirements, which could lead to less decentralization, although this is
subject to debate. To achieve a high level of scalability, Solana leverages,
among other things, parallel execution. A few other projects followed this
track, including Aptos, Sui, and notably Monad, which is EVM compatible.

The future of Solana hinges on upcoming projects, institutional adoption, and
addressing scalability challenges. Despite potential obstacles, Solana‚Äôs
resilience and potential for growth position it as a significant force in the
evolving crypto narrative. Comparing Solana to Ethereum, Solana‚Äôs scalability
and low fees position it as a strong competitor.

###### Ethereum ‚Äì a focus on infrastructure building:

In the previous crypto cycle, the soaring number of DApps on Ethereum led to
congestion and skyrocketing fees. **That‚Äôs why in 2023, the Ethereum ecosystem
mainly focused on fortifying its foundational infrastructure to face limiting
throughput.** The solution came in the form of OP STACK, a technology
leveraged by Coinbase to introduce BASE, a highly successful project.**On top
of that, various other solutions played integral roles in scaling protocols in
2023, including validity rollups, Zero-Knowledge sync, Starknet, Scroll, and
several others.** Validity rollups have a key advantage over optimistic
rollups: transactions are final as soon as they are anchored on the L1. In
contrast, on optimistic rollups, transactions are final as soon as the fraud
claim period is over (generally 7 days).

In the near future, we‚Äôll see a wide range of Layer-2 protocols enabling the
seamless operation of blockchain-intensive applications. For a deeper
exploration of the future trajectory of Ethereum and its capability to
facilitate the mainstream adoption of Web3, [refer to my comprehensive
publication](https://www.ledger.com/blog/on-the-future-of-ethereum-charles-
guillemet).

###### Bitcoin ‚Äì tackling a historical throughput challenge:

In 2023, the Bitcoin network addressed its long-standing challenge of slow
transaction speeds through the growing popularity of Layer-2 networks,
promising to improve transaction processing times significantly. **In this
regard, the Lightning Network gained significant traction in 2023 but remains
small, with around 5,000 BTC.** Over 70 LN-enabled wallets from providers like
BlueWallet, Muun, and Phoenix supported this progress, with adoption ranging
from individuals in inflation-hit nations to global corporations.

**In tandem with the Lightning Network‚Äôs progress, the Bitcoin ecosystem
experienced noteworthy advancements in roll-up technologies, featuring various
forms with unique attributes.** The landscape was enriched by significant
research, particularly with BitVM, and the resurgence of discussions
surrounding covenants and drive chains contributed to the ongoing evolution of
Bitcoin‚Äôs technological landscape.

##### **Trend #2: The Data Availability War**

When interacting with blockchains, users want to write data that can‚Äôt be
tampered with. Sometimes this data is programs that can be executed.
Sometimes, it‚Äôs simply read-only data that must be available. **A good example
of this is ZK Rollups.** Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) technologies ensures the
validity of Layer-2 (L2) state in the blockchain. However, accessing this
state also requires additional considerations. To enhance throughput,
execution is moved off-chain, but the data must remain accessible for
reconstruction. Transactional data is submitted as calldata on Ethereum,
ensuring availability for future reconstruction, and can be stored in
decentralized storage like IPFS or Arweave. Storing this data on-chain is less
efficient and expensive, as it only reconstructs the L2 state without
execution.

**To tackle this, Ethereum developers proposed to split the Ethereum data into
executable data (traditional blockchain space in call data) and non executable
data.** The implementation of EIP-4844 will introduce a new transaction type
for immutable and read-only Layer-2 data storage, which is not accessible by
the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This evolution of the Ethereum blockchain
is planned to be live soon. In January on Goerli and Sepolia, early February
on Holesky and soon after on mainnet! These EIPs align with the ZKRollup
roadmap, focusing on essential L2 data storage, and Execution Sharding
roadmap, specifically Proto-Danksharding (EIP-4844). Danksharding involves
breaking large datasets into smaller parts for parallel processing, relevant
in big data and AI. Proto-danksharding doesn‚Äôt implement sharding but offers
cheaper calldata storage that could potentially be sharded, enhancing Ethereum
scalability on L2.

On top of that, Celestia, Near and EigenDA are introduced as potential Data
Availability Layers, suggesting alternatives for storing data that doesn‚Äôt
need to be executed. These layers could play a crucial role and directly
compete with EIP-4844. Simply put, after the 2023 scalability battle, we
should witness the Data Availability war in 2024.

##### **Trend #3: Account Abstraction, becoming the next standard for user
interaction**

In March 2023, the Ethereum mainnet witnessed the introduction of EIP-4337, a
development establishing standards for Account Abstraction. This blockchain-
enabled technology aims to revolutionize user experience in crypto, as today‚Äôs
interactions with Externally Owned Accounts (EOA) remain basic.

**The potential transformative power of Account Abstraction lies in its
ability to enforce complex on-chain rules, promising a paradigm shift for
crypto users.** Recent strides in EIP-4337 mark substantial progress toward
realizing this transformative vision. However, several challenges must be
addressed. One such challenge is the inherent costliness of executing the
flexible governance model of Account Abstraction directly on the blockchain
compared to conventional EOA transactions. **On Ethereum‚Äôs Layer-1, the
limited scalability of the chain leads to high execution costs. Nevertheless,
on scalable Layer-2s, Account Abstraction could emerge as the default choice,
allowing users to define complex governance rules enforced by the Layer-2
consensus and anchored in the Ethereum Layer-1.**

[Read this article](https://www.ledger.com/blog/how-account-abstraction-could-
impact-the-crypto-landscape) to learn how ‚ÄúAccount Abstraction‚Äù promises to
improve user experience and why hardware wallets will serve as foundational
roots of trust in this emerging paradigm.

##### **Trend #4: Shared Security, a concept bound to shape crypto‚Äôs future**

‚ÄúShared Security‚Äù is a groundbreaking concept that marked 2023 and holds big
promises for the future of the industry. In crypto, starting new projects
involves daunting challenges, including a wide range of variables and costs to
support a growing user base. **The model of ‚ÄúShared Security‚Äù tackles this
challenge, as it involves applications pooling resources on a dependable
decentralized system, ensuring that the benefits of secure blockchain networks
are extended and utilized across various platforms, fostering a more
interconnected and resilient ecosystem.  **

Two notable platforms, Babylon and Eigenlayer, are actively contributing to
the realization of the Shared Security vision, albeit with distinct
approaches.

**Eigenlayer focuses on Ethereum‚Äôs Shared Security model, utilizing a
mechanism known as ‚ÄúRestaking.‚Äù** This allows users to use Ethereum to stake
other services concurrently, enabling participation in validation services and
receiving payment. Eigenlayer also introduces innovations like the Data
Availability Layer, which enhances data transfer speed using Roll-ups
technology. **In contrast, Babylon leverages the Bitcoin network to secure
decentralized applications.** It introduces various protocols, including the
Timestamping Protocol, which identifies Bitcoin‚Äôs secure time, establishing it
as a universal standard for use with other Proof-of-Stake networks.

The significance of Shared Security in shaping the future of crypto lies in
its capacity to provide a collaborative and secure foundation for a diverse
array of applications. As Babylon and Eigenlayer forge partnerships and
navigate challenges, the pursuit of Shared Security emerges as a pioneering
force bound to shape the trajectory of crypto.

##### **Trend #5: NFTs: A Rapidly Shifting Landscape**

The NFT hype fuelled the previous crypto cycle, with OpenSea reigning supreme
in the digital collectibles realm. Despite numerous attempts by competitors,
none could unseat its dominance. However, as the NFT market, like the broader
crypto economy, succumbed to the bear market by the end of 2022, a game-
changer emerged: Blur.

###### Blur: the birth of a disruptive NFT platform

Blur, unveiled in October 2022 by
[@PacmanBlur](https://twitter.com/pacmanblur) (also the creator of Blast),
swiftly disrupted the NFT market, challenging OpenSea‚Äôs dominance. Within four
months, Blur‚Äôs strategic approach, including zero marketplace fees and a 0.5%
minimum creator royalty, has garnered significant attention. The introduction
of the BLUR token also marked a pivotal moment in Blur‚Äôs growth strategy, as
it empowered BLUR token holders to participate in decentralized governance,
influencing key platform parameters. The big token‚Äôs airdrop fostered
community engagement by promising decentralized decision-making.

Blur‚Äôs impact on OpenSea is evident in key performance indicators. Trading
volume on Blur surpassed OpenSea‚Äôs within days of its token launch, and daily
users tripled post-airdrop. With a trade count comparable to OpenSea, Blur
demonstrated its ability to compete with established players.

[![](https://www.ledger.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Capture-
decran-2024-01-12-a-13.45.38-1024x547.png)](https://dune.com/hildobby/NFTs)

As the above chart highlights, the average sale size on Blur is higher, driven
by a focus on high-value trades. Blur‚Äôs royalty fees model allows creators to
earn full royalties everywhere, unlike OpenSea‚Äôs limitations. A loyalty
feature incentivizes exclusive listings on Blur, aiming for 100% user loyalty.

Blur‚Äôs success rests on three pillars:  an extensive array of NFT choices,
impressive speed (10x faster and 20% more gas-efficient than Gem), and a user-
friendly interface. On top of that, BLUR tokenomics, inspired by Uniswap‚Äôs UNI
vesting schedule, emphasizes community involvement and a straightforward
distribution approach. The governance token is distributed based on a point
system tied to liquidity provision, bidding, and risk-taking.

Blur‚Äôs success poses a challenge to OpenSea‚Äôs market leadership. Despite the
potential impact of token airdrop completion, Blur‚Äôs product-market fit, lower
fees, and superior trading tools position it as a strong contender in the
competitive NFT landscape. The ongoing market dynamics will determine whether
Blur can sustain its momentum and become a lasting force in the NFT ecosystem.

###### Is EVM still the house of NFTs?

Unexpected contenders are challenging Ethereum‚Äôs long-standing dominance in
the NFT landscape: Bitcoin and Solana‚Ä¶ marking a new era for digital
collectibles?

  * **Bitcoin has experienced a remarkable surge in NFT trading, fueled by the popularity of ordinal inscriptions in 2023, making Bitcoin the biggest chain in terms of NFT volume in Q4.** These inscriptions enable the creation of NFT-like assets directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. The appeal lies in the trust in Bitcoin, the affordability and the uniqueness of storing NFTs directly on the blockchain, expanding Bitcoin‚Äôs presence in the NFT market. Bitcoin ordinals have also led to a substantial increase in the blockchain‚Äôs mempool, reaching an all-time high, resulting in slower processing times and higher fees, and reflecting the challenges of adapting to increased demand for blockchain services.

  * **Solana has also emerged as a strong competitor, recording higher NFT trading volumes than Ethereum.** Successful initiatives and partnerships, including Jito‚Äôs airdrop distributing $165 million worth of tokens, have contributed to this upswing. Tensor, a Solana-based NFT marketplace, has seen increased activity, with speculations about potential airdrops driving sales. The Pudgy Penguins NFT collection has gained attention with its innovative online game and expansion into physical toys, exemplifying how NFTs bridge digital and physical realms.

As examined, the NFT market is undergoing a paradigm shift, with Bitcoin and
Solana challenging Ethereum‚Äôs historical supremacy. This competition is
fostering innovation, introducing new methods of NFT creation and trading, and
reshaping the NFT ecosystem structural dynamics.

non-fungible-tokens/nft-overview)

#### **Part II: Predictions for the year ahead**

As we embark on a new year, it is now time to assess the possible driving
forces for the year ahead. In this section, I answer the following questions:
which blockchain protocol will prevail in the near future? Which consumer-
facing use cases could play the most important role as 2024 unfolds? In bonus,
I provide a few complementary forecasts for the months ahead.

##### Which blockchain protocol could win the scalability battle?

As I‚Äôve examined, the blockchain sector has faced profound scalability
limitations during the previous cycle, but these limitations now have several
solutions. In parallel, determining which solutions will prevail in the medium
term remains uncertain.

The Cosmos ecosystem, built on Tendermint, boasts a robust design, but also
faces adoption barriers due to the Atom token‚Äôs peripheral role and limited
developer ecosystem. Without introducing novel apps or features compared to
the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), Solana could lose its potential as an
‚ÄúEthereum-killer.‚Äù **However, the native interoperability and streamlined
deployment of a blockchain app on Cosmos could play a significant role in the
upcoming cycle, supporting an ecosystem rich in applications like
Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) and Data Availability.** While Solana returned
unexpectedly in 2023, its one-chain model and enhanced robustness position it
favorably for the next cycle.

Ethereum, with its expansive and continually growing ecosystem, holds a
significant advantage. **The rollup design promises a growing range of new
applications at the Layer-2 level, potentially positioning Ethereum as a
settlement layer for EVM chains.** This could mean that the mainnet virtual
machine would become useless, and the Ethereum design would be overly complex
for doing settlement only, leaving the door open for a Vampire attack!  **Yet,
Ethereum‚Äôs rollup strategy encounters challenges, which could lead us to a
Data Availability war.** Although Proto-danksharding will be implemented soon,
other solutions may outcompete, delaying the realization of the danksharding
vision.

##### Which consumer-facing use cases are to be expected in 2024?

Solving scalability challenges opens up affordable blockchain space, paving
the way for previously unfeasible apps and experiences. This begs the
question: which use cases will prevail in 2024?

**Web3 gaming emerges as a significant use case, transitioning from a niche
primarily due to scalability constraints.** The Play-And-Earn model could
realistically replace the Play-To-Earn paradigm, and players could interact
with blockchains without knowing it. Account Abstraction is bound to play a
crucial role in this emerging gaming model, simplifying complexity, adding a
governance layer, enabling social recovery, and facilitating third-party
sponsorship of user transactions.

Advancements in blockchain-powered Decentralized Identity are also to be
anticipated, although mainstream adoption of the Self-Sovereign-Identity
stack, with high interoperability and private identity attributes, remains
difficult to reach in the medium-term.

Last but not least, ‚ÄúDecentralized Social Media‚Äù could capture significant
attention as they confront the widely recognized inefficiencies and
centralization issues at the core of today‚Äôs social media landscape. In this
context, Decentralized Social Media could emerge as viable solutions, enabling
user-centric models built upon principles of data ownership and censorship
resistance.

##### Complementary predictions

Here are a few complementary predictions that I believe will shape 2024:

  * The re-staking and ‚Äúshared security‚Äù model will spark discussions and competition, possibly leading to failures when incentives deviate from game theory frameworks.

  * Ecosystem fragmentation will heighten the importance of (trustless) bridges, though unfortunate hacks may occur.

  * The stablecoin market will continue to grow, with different projects addressing various needs, posing challenges and opportunities in terms of transparency, governance, and regulatory compliance. In this regard, we might unfortunately witness new disasters. 

  * Bitcoin will retain its dominance, fueled by traditional finance‚Äôs increasing involvement. 

  * The Bitcoin blockchain space will be more scarce, and the rise of Ordinals will drive higher transaction costs. The Lightning Network‚Äôs adoption will remain limited, but the Bitcoin hash rate could reach all-time highs despite the halving.

  * After the approval of the U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, the U.S. will witness the mainstream introduction of Ethereum Spot ETFs, while blockchains will gradually become preferred infrastructures for value exchange.

  * Traditional Finance adoption will progress significantly, giving rise to new financial products based on the world‚Äôs main crypto-asset. We will see a prominent trend of TradFi assets tokenization that can be exchanged efficiently on Blockchains (faster, cheaper, and on a transparent ledger). We‚Äôll also witness traditional banks offering crypto to their customers. 

  * The U.S. and EU continue their efforts on Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) projects, though none is expected to be released in 2024. Regulators will provide increased clarity on the use of crypto-assets.

#### **Closing Thoughts**

Today, the world counts nearly 5.3 Billion Internet users. However, such a
digital shift wouldn‚Äôt have materialized without exponential broadband speed
and scalable Internet infrastructures reached decades ago. And the same is
true for the blockchain field today: crypto use cases require scalable
protocols to spread to billions of users.

As we navigate the multi-faceted technical landscape of blockchains, it
becomes clear that we are currently in the midst of what can be described as
the ‚Äúbroadband moment‚Äù of the crypto revolution. As blockchains become more
scalable and clear winners emerge, the next step will undoubtedly be the
growing accessibility of consumer-facing applications that hundreds of
millions of users will be able to access.
