Do I need the Ledger Live app or a third-party software wallet?

#### Ledger Live or third-party software wallet?

__Why do I need a Ledger hardware wallet?

Keeping your private keys offline, in a hardware wallet is far more secure
than keeping it online. In addition, with hardware wallets like Ledger, you’re
storing and securing your crypto by yourself. That way, you maintain exclusive
control over your private keys, and therefore, your crypto.

__Do Ledger hardware wallets only work with Ledger Live?

The Ledger Live app is built from the ground up to be compatible with Ledger
hardware wallets. The app supports 1000s of cryptocurrencies, including
Bitcoin and Ethereum, making it an ideal companion for your hardware wallet.
If you want to manage assets not supported by Ledger Live, you can use a
third-party wallet together with a Ledger hardware wallet.

__Is using a third-party wallet with Ledger hardware wallets secure?

You can use your hardware wallet with a compatible third-party software
wallet. When using third-party wallets, make sure to get them through their
official websites to avoid potential phishing attempts, and carefully review
every transaction before signing it with your hardware wallet.
