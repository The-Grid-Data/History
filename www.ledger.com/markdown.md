## Testimonials

____

“Ledger = peace of mind. I'm sure some of us know that unsettling feeling when
you know you need a Ledger but haven't quite organized yourself to get it
sorted. If I did it all again, I'd start with having a Ledger.”

**Janet Onagah** @Janet_Oganah

"I got hacked in January and lost 1000s worth of NFTs. I felt disgusted, lost,
and willing to quit. Until my friend told me he's ordering a Ledger. So, we
bought the duo deal. Since then, I've been sleeping."

**PrimeNic.eth** @primenic_eth

“I use multiple Ledgers. Different colours = different uses.Public Wallet.
Never touch long term storage. Day to day fund holdings. A back up just in
case.”

**winny.eth** @winnyeth

"I have 3 Ledgers. Hot Wallet: minting/drawings etc. Main wallet: store most
NFTs. Vault wallet: cold storage of crypto."

**2160** @rekt2160

“I have 5 Ledger total. My personal NFT bag. 1 for testing. And 1 for each of
my 3 daughters.”

**Fanzo 🧢 11.11.22** @iSocialFanz

"If I could, I would name my Ledger Hagrid. Cause it's the keeper of my keys."

**Petrica Butusina** @PetricaButusina

"My Ledger is already called "Stew". As it is the steward who looks after my
crypto & NFTs, so I can sleep at night."

**Lkmland Crypto 💫** @LkmlandCrypto

"Ledger makes cold storage downright easy. My NFTs land infinitely safer and I
don’t have to feel as paranoid about connecting to new smart contracts."

**Matt Oney** @MattOney93

## FAQ

Find answers to some of the most common questions.

What is a crypto wallet?

Thinking about buying crypto or NFTs? You’ll need a [crypto
wallet](https://www.ledger.com/academy/basic-basics/2-how-to-own-crypto/what-
is-a-crypto-wallet).

When you create a wallet, two keys are generated: a private one and a public
one. The wallet stores your keys and enables you to sign transactions,
generate new addresses, initiate transfers, track portfolio balances, manage
your crypto, and interact with dApps.

Crypto wallets come in many forms, from hardware wallets, like Ledger’s, to
mobile apps that you can download on your phone or tablet.

How do crypto wallets work?

When you buy crypto like Bitcoin and Ethereum, you’re issued two keys: [one is
public and the other is
private](https://www.ledger.com/academy/blockchain/what-are-public-keys-and-
private-keys).

The public key can be compared to a bank account number that you can share
with third parties to receive crypto without worrying that your assets will be
compromised.

The private key signs transactions and allows you to send and receive crypto.
It’s crucial to keep your private keys secure and secret. If anyone has access
to them, they will also have access to any crypto assets associated with those
keys.

A crypto wallet stores your private keys and gives you access to your assets.

What are the different types of crypto wallets?

There are different types of crypto wallets, each with its own benefits and
drawbacks.  
[Hot wallets](https://www.ledger.com/academy/glossary/hot-wallet) are
connected to the internet and usually convenient to use, however, they are
also vulnerable to online attacks. Examples include web-based, mobile, and
desktop wallets. [Cold wallets](https://www.ledger.com/academy/glossary/cold-
wallet) keep your private keys offline and out of reach of online threats.
Examples include paper and hardware wallets.

Wallets can also be categorized as custodial or non-custodial, depending on
who holds the private keys. Storing your crypto in a custodial wallet means
that a third party controls your private keys and, therefore, your assets. In
contrast, non-custodial wallets, like Ledger’s, enable you to fully own and
control your crypto.

Why do I need a hardware wallet?

Hot wallets store private keys on systems connected to the internet, which
makes them susceptible to online attacks. Keeping your crypto on an exchange
also means you have no true ownership or control over it. If the exchange
files for bankruptcy or pauses withdrawals, you lose access to your funds.

Hardware wallets store your private keys offline, giving you full control and
enhanced security. Even if you misplace or lose your hardware wallet, you can
get a new one and use your Secret Recovery Phrase to access your assets.

How to get a crypto wallet?

Ready to get started? Here are the steps for getting your crypto wallet:

  1. Get a [Ledger hardware wallet](https://shop.ledger.com/). It stores your private keys in a secure, offline environment giving you peace of mind and complete control over your assets. All Ledger crypto wallets are powered by an industry-leading Secure Element chip, together with Ledger’s proprietary OS that protects your crypto & NFTs from sophisticated hacks.
  2. Pair your Ledger crypto wallet with the [Ledger Live app](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live) to easily manage your crypto, keep track of your portfolio, and securely access a wide range of dApps and Web3 services. All in one convenient place!
  3. Add crypto to your Ledger wallet. Ledger has partnered with leading third-party providers so you can securely buy, swap, stake and grow your crypto through the Ledger Live app. Your crypto will be sent to the safety of your Ledger hardware wallet.
