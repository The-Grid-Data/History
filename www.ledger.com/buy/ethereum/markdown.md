## Buy Ethereum and store them with the leader in crypto security

__

Security

Ledger offers the best security for your crypto: your assets always remain
safe and in your control.

__

All-in-one

One place for all your crypto. Our hardware wallets are compatible with [more
than 1800 different assets](https://www.ledger.com/supported-crypto-assets),
including Ethereum.

__

Control

By combining a hardware wallet with an app, Ledger gives you full control over
your crypto and lets you access all key services securely: manage, buy, swap
your crypto – and more. You are in charge.

## Why consider a hardware wallet when buying crypto

A Ethereum wallet helps you protect your private key, not just storing your
Ethereum. If you are fairly new to cryptocurrencies you might still be
struggling with the concept of private key and why it’s so important. Perhaps
you just get into cryptocurrency by purchasing coins on an exchange platform
but didn’t even realize that they hold the private keys to your
cryptocurrency.

When you own cryptocurrencies, what you really own is a [private
key](https://www.ledger.com/academy/whats-a-private-key), a critical piece of
information used to authorize outgoing transactions on the blockchain network.
Holding the private keys gives you access to your crypto, like holding a pin
code to your debit card; in short it gives you access to your funds.

_« If you are keeping your crypto assets on an exchange, you are entrusting a
third party with these private keys and mandating them to serve as a
safeguard. »_

Being a crypto investor requires taking security seriously and owning your
private keys gives you much more power and control. The main principle behind
hardware wallets is to provide full isolation between the private keys and
your easy-to-hack computer or smartphone. The only people you can trust for
storing your crypto assets is yourself.

##  What is Ethereum (ETH) ?

The concept for Ethereum was proposed by a 19-year old named Vitalik Buterin
in 2013 as a platform that took the idea of Bitcoin’s blockchain and extended
it to encompass the storage and execution of Turing-complete computer
programs. Ethereum has since become the fifth fastest growing open-source
project on Github with an unusual history and compelling potential.

cannot do with your own money. Buying Ethereum offers you the means to send
money from anywhere, anytime, without any extra time or fees.

__________  4/5

I got my ledger after a lot of people advised I should keep my bitcoin safe
with a hardware wallet. It was really easy to set up and i'm really happy with
it

Marc O.  
__________  4/5

Really nice. Fast delivery, good online tutorials, the cold wallet has support
for multiple apps and also supports 'staking' using Ledger Live.

Reginald D.  
__________  3/5

recently purchased the Nano Ledger X, and the simple, easy-to-use interface
helped me to easily transfer my Bitcoins from Coinbase. Products like the Nano
Ledger X will help cryptos such as Bitcoin become adopted the broader society.
