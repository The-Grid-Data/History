---  
— A crypto wallet stores the private and public keys that give you access to
your cryptocurrencies and allows you to send, receive and manage your crypto  
  
— A software wallet, also known as a hot wallet, is an application that exists
on a connected device such as a phone or computer. It is always connected to
the internet.  
  
— Software wallets make it convenient to access dApps but are susceptible to
online attacks. They should always be paired with a hardware device for
security.  
  
Crypto users can store their digital assets at a unique blockchain address,
and retain absolute control over it via the corresponding cryptographic
private key. This private key is secured by something known as a crypto
wallet.

If we’ve lost you already, make sure you read the full article on [what a
crypto wallet](https://www.ledger.com/academy/basic-basics/2-how-to-own-
crypto/what-is-a-crypto-wallet) is. But essentially, a crypto wallet stores
the public and private keys for your blockchain addresses, allowing you to
access crypto, monitor your balance and transact on the blockchain. These
crypto wallets can also store the private keys for a near infinite number of
accounts. And, they’re all protected by a single recovery phrase—a sort of
master key for all of your private keys.

Exactly how that crypto wallet stores your private keys, and your secret
recovery phrase, very much impacts the security of your wallet. And as a
result, there are multiple types of crypto wallets, including custodial
wallets, multisig wallets and even hardware wallets. But one of the most
popular types of wallets, and the subject of this article, is the software
wallet. Usually, these are often crypto user’s first type of wallet. But
they’re not just for beginners, so what are they exactly?

## **What Is a Software Wallet?**

In a very simple sense, a software wallet is an application that you install
on your computer or mobile phone that interacts with the blockchain; allowing
you to send, receive, and manage your crypto assets. But of course, there’s a
bit more to it than that.

Firstly, it’s important to note that crypto wallets—software wallets
included—do not actually store crypto at all. Crypto is stored on the
blockchain, and your crypto wallet merely stores the keys that grant you
access to manage it, if your wallet is non-custodial that is. And in fact.
That’s one of the most important aspects of a software wallet.

### **Software Wallets are Non-Custodial**

To explain, software wallets put you in direct possession of your private
keys. This ensures you can still access your assets on the blockchain
directly, even if the wallet interface itself ceases to exist.

This contrasts with custodial crypto wallets, such as those used on
centralized crypto exchanges. To explain, a custodial wallet also uses
software to operate but it doesn’t leave you in possession of the private key
for that account. Instead, the central entity issuing the wallet (generally an
exchange) retains that account’s private key for itself. You gain access by
entering a username and password into the centralized entity’s interface.

### **Software Wallets Are Simply Software**

Then, like the name suggests, software wallets are simply software that is
installed and managed via a host device, such as a smartphone or laptop. To
initiate and confirm transactions, it uses your host device’s screen to
present you with an interface. Plus it keeps  your private key in an encrypted
state within your browser’s data store. This is called “hot storage” and it
essentially means your private keys are easy to access, great for user
experience, not so great for security. But before we get there, let’s dive
into how software wallets work exactly.

## **How Does a Software Wallet Work?**

Like most crypto wallets, software wallets generate  public and private key
pairs. For all crypto wallets, a public key is viewable by others and can be
shared with the sender/recipient. A private key, on the other hand, should
never be shared with anyone, as it is what allows one to access the funds.
Rather than storing your crypto, your crypto wallet stores these private keys.

Software wallets store both public and private keys within its interface on
your internet-connected device, like a laptop or smartphone. Once you install
the wallet’s interface on your computer or mobile phone, you can manage your
assets from there. The application is normally protected by a password, so
that only you can access the wallet, create accounts and transact with the
private keys it stores.

When you go to sign a transaction, it’s this piece of software on your device
that presents you with the intent and prompts you to sign. In short, the
intent is like an electronic proposal. When you read the transaction and
decide to click confirm, the software wallet uses your private key to sign the
transaction, then sends that signed transaction to the rest of the network
using your internet-connected device. It’s literally that simple.

So, now you know how they work, you might want to know the pros and cons of
using a software (hot) wallet in the first place.

## Benefits of Software Wallets

Software wallets are a popular choice for crypto users for a number of
reasons:

### **Minimal Barriers to Entry  **

Firstly, anyone can download a software wallet and install it on their device.
Plus, they are usually free to download, install and use.

### **Web3 Compatible  **

Lots of blockchain apps will support a select few crypto wallets. The most
popular software wallets tend to have the biggest range of blockchain apps,
services and platforms to choose from. They are also very versatile, with many
also offering bridge or swap services between multiple chains.  

### **Ease of use  **

These wallets have a simple interface for beginners, making them popular if
you’re just getting started with crypto. They are also very quick to set up.
Since the app resides on your connected device, they are also easy to use on a
daily basis. Once you open the wallet app, you’re already connected to the
internet and ready to start interacting with dApps and DeFi. This can be both
an advantage and a risk.

## Risks of Using a Software Wallet

Despite the many benefits of software or hot wallets, they also have some
significant drawbacks.

### **Online Keys Are Not Secure**

The most significant risk of using a software wallet is that it typically
stores your private key in your browser’s data store, albeit in an encrypted
state. However, this means your private keys are susceptible to online threats
since your browser is always connected to the internet. Unfortunately, clever
hackers can use the connection to deploy spyware to your device and gain
critical information such as your login details or extract your private key
directly.

The [TrustWallet hack](https://blog.ledger.com/Funds-of-every-wallet-created-
with-the-Trust-Wallet-browser-extension-could-have-been-stolen/) is a good
example of this type of attack in action. In this case, hackers spotted a
vulnerability in the wallet software and used it to gain access to users’
private keys remotely.

In short, not isolating your private keys from your internet connection leaves
you vulnerable to any bad actor looking to target your device remotely. The
worst bit is: You’ll have no idea until it’s too late.

### **On-Screen Transactions Are Not Tamper Proof**

Transacting with any wallet also poses another potential attack vector: The
screen it uses. Software wallets present transaction details on the screen of
your device, enabling you to cryptographically sign to confirm. However,
devices such as smartphones and laptops are vulnerable to hacking. Once you
have some malware on your device a hacker can interfere with the display of
your phone or computer.

That means any device that could contain malware can not be fully trusted. Any
time you trust the screen of your laptop or smartphone, you could be signing a
malicious transaction. But there is no alternative for software wallet users.
Your only choice is to trust the screen, without first verifying what you’re
signing. At that point, it’s too late.

## Software Vs Hardware Wallets: What’s the difference?

Well firstly, a [hardware wallet](https://www.ledger.com/academy/crypto-
hardware-wallet) is a physical device and physical devices require physical
components—not to mention a team of experts to design, produce and distribute
them. This means that hardware wallets are not free.

Software wallets, on the other hand, are pieces of software that operate via a
host device, such as your laptop or smartphone. As such, they tend to be free
of charge.  

Next, the biggest difference is in where they store private keys. Both
hardware and software wallets are non-custodial–meaning they allow you to
control your own private keys–however that’s largely where their similarities
end.

To illustrate, a hardware wallet secures your private keys on a computer chip
within a specific physical device, rather than simply on your internet
connected device. That means the chip, and therefore your private key, stays
isolated from your connection and the risks associated with it. Even if a
hacker tries to exploit your internet connected hardware, they will never be
able to extract your private keys. They are simply out of reach. Ledger
hardware wallets even go a step further in keeping you secure using a Secure
Element chip—the same chip you might find in your passport or bank card. This
tamper-proof chip guarantees that your keys stay just as private as you hoped.

Finally, while software wallets show you what you’re signing for on a computer
screen that can be tampered with, a hardware wallet displays transaction
details on the hardware device itself. Since Ledger hardware wallets use the
secure element they are impermeable to hacks, plus, with the Trusted Display
you can be absolutely sure of what you’re signing before you confirm.

## How To Use a Software Wallet Correctly

Crypto wallets are key to accessing the cryptocurrency space; but not every
platform accepts every wallet. While it would be most secure to use a hardware
wallet for all platforms, that’s not always an option.

Luckily, even when you must use a software wallet, you can combine it with a
hardware wallet to experience the best of both worlds. While the software
wallet provides you access to the platform you want, your hardware wallet can
protect your private keys and sign transactions offline. This way, you can
easily access apps and services with the confidence your private keys are
secure.

Connecting these two wallet types is simple, but the process varies slightly
from wallet to wallet. So, before you start connecting your wallets, let’s
explore some of the most popular software wallets today and how you can
connect your Ledger to enhance the security of each of them.

## Most Popular Software Wallets in 2023

There are a variety of software wallets available in the market; perhaps too
many to choose from! However, let’s take a look at some of the most popular
software, or “hot” wallets on the market today.

### Metamask

MetaMask is a leading self-custodial software wallet that enables you to
manage your crypto assets and NFTs with ease. Plus, it supports multiple
blockchains—including Ethereum, BSC, Avalanche, and layer 2 networks such as
Optimism, Arbitrum, and Polygon. Not only that, MetaMask also allows you to
send and receive ETH-based tokens too, broadcast transactions, and interact
seamlessly with dApps.

You can either use its browser extension, available in Chrome, Firefox, and
Brave, or its mobile app, which is available on both iOS and Android devices.
And to maximize its security, you can [use MetaMask with a Ledger
hardware](https://www.ledger.com/academy/security/the-safest-way-to-use-
metamask) wallet. This is an incredibly seamless, and secure experience. Even
MetaMask itself suggests you use a hardware wallet in conjunction with their
own wallets.

### Phantom

This non-custodial wallet is tailored for the Solana blockchain. With Phantom,
users can trade, receive, send, store, and manage assets conveniently. The
wallet lets you swap tokens, display NFTs and even stake SOL. Plus, of course,
you can also use it to access countless dApps on Solana, Polygon, and
Ethereum.

Phantom is also available on mobile phones as a Chrome, Brave, Firefox, and
Edge browser extension. To protect your new Solana hot wallet, make sure you
[connect your Phantom wallet with Ledger](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-
us/articles/4408131265169-Set-up-and-use-Phantom-to-access-your-Ledger-Solana-
SOL-account?docs=true). Using these tools together, you can access countless
blockchain apps while keeping your keys offline and under your control.

### Keplr

Keplr is the non-custodial software wallet which allows seamless interchain
functionality within the Cosmos ecosystem. In fact, it’s often called the
first ever IBC-enabled wallet for the cosmos ecosystem. That means you can
easily access countless dapps in the IBC ecosystem, such as decentralized
exchanges (DEXs), DeFi lending and borrowing platforms and much much more.
Keplr operates as both a mobile app, available on Anroid and iOS, and a
browser extension, available on Chrome, Firefox and Edge. And with over
900,000 users, it’s still the most popular wallet for exploring the Cosmos
ecosystem. Luckily, you can also protect your Keplr wallet using a Ledger
hardware wallet. [Connect your Keplr wallet to
Ledger](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/4411149814417-Set-up-and-
use-Keplr-to-access-your-Ledger-Cosmos-ATOM-account?docs=true) and benefit
from the best of both worlds: A whole ecosystem at your disposal without
compromising on security.

### Temple

Temple Wallet serves as both a dedicated mobile app and a browser extension
designed for interacting with the Tezos blockchain. With this wallet, you can
securely hold, stake, and swap Tezos-based tokens and collectibles. It
simplifies account importing from other Tezos wallets and supports simple
private keys, mnemonics, and fundraiser account imports.

You can create, import, and manage multiple accounts through a single
interface using Temple Wallet. Plus it also supports many tezos dApps. Not
only that, you can also [connect Temple to
Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/academy/the-safest-way-to-use-temple-wallet-
with-ledger-nano) to benefit from the security of the Ledger ecosystem while
exploring web3.

### Talisman

Talisman was initially a Polkadot and Kusama wallet but has recently announced
full support of Ethereum, and EVM Layer 2 blockchains like Base, Optimism, and
Aribtrum.

[Talisman Polkadot and Ethereum wallet](https://www.talisman.xyz/) simplifies
Web3 for beginners and unleashes advanced capabilities for experts. Designed
to be multi-chain, it allows seamless interaction with various blockchains
while ensuring the security of your assets. Create and manage the keys for
your accounts, send funds, connect your Ledger crypto wallet, and sign
transactions on any DApp. Talisman also supports Ethereum-style accounts so
you can manage assets and utilize DApps on Moonbeam, Moonriver, Astar, Acala’s
EVM+, and others.

## **Software and Hardware Wallets: The Best Of Both Worlds     **

So, now you know what a software wallet does, how it works and which kind of
tasks they are perfect for. Now all that’s left is using one while considering
the risks.

Remember–using a software wallet without protecting it with a hardware wallet
may put your funds at risk. Your assets are only as safe as your private key.
If someone gets hold of that, they also have access to your crypto!

Then, beyond that, even software wallets protected by hardware wallets can’t
stop you from interacting with malicious smart contracts. The only way to
truly stay safe is to do your own research, and stay vigilant.
