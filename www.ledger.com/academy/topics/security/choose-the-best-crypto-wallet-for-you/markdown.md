---  
— Choosing a crypto wallet can be tricky; there are so many different types,
and not all wallets will support the assets or functions you require.  
  
— Choosing the best wallet for you depends on your needs: some offer the best
security while others are capable of supporting multiple networks and asset
types.  
  
— Understanding how different wallets work and what they can offer can help
you make an informed decision.  
  
So you are ready to get yourself a [crypto
wallet](https://www.ledger.com/academy/basic-basics/2-how-to-own-crypto/what-
is-a-crypto-wallet), but you’re not sure which wallet is best for your
specific needs. It might be overwhelming at first. Indeed, there are so many
different types of wallets, offering different functionalities and ways to
interact with blockchain.

That said, they all have some core features. They allow users to store the
private keys that control their accounts, plus offer an interface that allows
you to manage those accounts.  Understanding what each of them do is just half
of the puzzle though.

See, that’s largely where the similarities in crypto wallets end. Exactly
where they store those private keys, and how the wallet’s interface works, can
vary greatly depending on their design.

So if they’re all so different, how do you choose which crypto wallet is best
for you?

Well, to help you choose which wallet you might need, let’s first explore the
different types of features you might want to take into consideration.

## How To Choose The Best Crypto Wallet For You

Each type of wallet has its strengths, but also its weaknesses. So, before you
choose the same crypto wallet as all of your friends, you might want to
consider some of these key questions first.

### Does It Offer Self-Custody?

Firstly, some wallets allow you true ownership or your digital assets. Then
others merely allow you to use their interface, forcing you to forfeit the
ownership of your assets in the process. Typically, custodial wallets are
operated by centralized exchanges. Instead of allowing you to manage your
private keys yourself, they manage the keys to your account for you.
Unfortunately, this means they have the true ownership of your funds.

### Is It Secure?

Of course, the next thing to consider is possibly the most important:
security. While all sorts of crypto wallets offer all manners of different
use-cases, what’s the point if it can’t actually protect your precious assets?

The secret to a secure wallet is down to where and how it stores and accesses
your private keys. Anyone with access to your private keys has access to your
entire wallet. Therefore, it’s imperative that your crypto wallet stores your
private keys in a place no one else but you can access them.

Hackers will attempt to gain remote access to your private keys by infecting
your internet connected device— then tricking you into either handing over
control by weaponizing your smartphone or laptop’s screen, or by finding and
extracting your public keys from your browser’s data store.

But it’s not just digital hacks you have to worry about, it’s also physical
hacks. For example, you wouldn’t want to store your private keys on an
untrustworthy, unaudited or weakly secured computer chip. That’s why it’s
important to compare in terms of their protection against physical hacks.

### Does it Support Multiple Networks?

In addition, many crypto wallets are designed to work for a single network.
This means you’ll need a separate account for every blockchain network you
access. Yes–that means you cannot use the same account for storing both
Bitcoin and Ether. That said, there are lots of wallets—including Ledger
devices— which let you create multiple accounts on several blockchains. So, if
you’re planning to use multiple networks, you might be looking for something
with this capability.

### Does it Support Multiple Asset Types?

Even within the same ecosystem though, there are also multiple different
wallets you can choose from; with many designed specifically for supporting
one type of asset over the other.

While some crypto wallets will only offer support for coins, others will also
support fungible and non-fungible tokens. That means if you want to store and
manage Bitcoin Ordinals, you’ll need a specific type of crypto wallet to do
so.

So with all these things considered, you’re ready to find the best crypto
wallet for you. Let’s explore each type of crypto wallet and what they are
designed for.

## What’s the Best Crypto Wallet for Secure Crypto Storage?

If you’re storing cryptocurrencies, security should be of the utmost
importance. There are several different threats to your digital assets, with
some wallets providing better protection from these threats than others.

The first risk your wallet may encounter is remote hacking. To explain,
software wallets store private keys on your host device–the same one connected
to the internet. This means that hackers with access to your smartphone or
laptop may be able to either extract your private keys and take control of
your wallet or trick you into signing a malicious transaction that gives them
power to take what they like.

To combat this particular threat, hardware wallets offer the most secure
option.

### Hardware Wallets

To explain, a [hardware wallet](https://www.ledger.com/academy/crypto-
hardware-wallet) is a physical device. Unlike software wallets, they keep
private keys in a computer chip, stored safely and securely away from your
internet-connected device. This means that if your web2 device, such as your
laptop or smartphone, is hacked, you can still trust the transaction details
on the screen of your hardware wallet.

A key risk of hardware wallets is physical hacking. Each hardware wallet has a
different security model, so checking that your hardware wallet has effective
components to combat physical hacking is a must. Firstly, most hardware
wallets offer a sort of two factor authentication. To explain, every time you
transact with a hardware wallet you will have to enter a code on the physical
device.

Ledger devices use a PINcode, a unique 4-6 digit code that serves as the first
barrier for a physical hack. Moreover, they store your private keys in a
Secure Element chip—the same chip you might find in a passport or bank card.
These tamper-proof chips keep your private keys in an offline environment,
making it harder for hackers to steal your digital assets.

Hardware wallets are fantastic for secure storage, with Ledger devices
offering even more security than most. However, they do come with a risk: You.
If you interact with a malicious smart contract, your hardware wallet might
not be able to protect your assets.

To explain, malicious smart contracts may present themselves as harmless apps
or platforms, then fool you into signing away your most valuable assets. A lot
of blockchain transactions are impossible to read in human language, and
signing a transaction like this is called “[blind
signing](https://www.ledger.com/academy/cryptos-greatest-weakness-blind-
signing-explained)”. In these cases, you can’t know the result of a
transaction before approving it—which could put your assets at risk.

### Cold Wallets

So, how do you store crypto without making mistakes and signing away your
crypto? Well, you may want to consider setting up a [cold
wallet](https://www.ledger.com/academy/topics/security/what-is-a-cold-wallet).
To explain, a cold wallet is a crypto wallet that never interacts with
blockchain apps or smart contracts. It’s purely for sending and receiving
cryptocurrencies.

Although there are plenty of different types of cold wallet, typically, users
set up cold wallet accounts on their existing hardware wallet. That’s because
your accounts on a hardware wallet are completely separate from each other,
meaning an account that interacts with a smart contract cannot affect another
account which doesn’t. This allows you to keep one account completely
cold–used only for sending and receiving assets. Meanwhile, you can have
another separate account you use purely for connecting to web3 apps and
services.

Using this method, the only way your wallet—and all of the accounts within
it—can become compromised, is if someone gains access to your secret recovery
phrase. Remember: your Secret recovery phrase is like the master key for all
of your private keys controlled by a specific wallet. That means anyone with
access to the secret recovery phrase can control every single one of the
associated accounts. That’s why keeping it safe and secure is so important.

## What’s the Best Crypto Wallet for Interacting with Apps and Services?

Speaking of apps and services, many web3 explorers get involved in crypto
purely for those means. To explain, dApps come in many shapes and sizes;
including decentralized exchanges, DeFi lending and borrowing platforms, and
even blockchain games and metaverses. However, these sorts of platforms will
typically only provide you access using one of a select choice of wallets. And
more often than not, these select few wallets are software (or hot) wallets.

### Software (Hot) Wallets

[Software wallets](https://www.ledger.com/academy/topics/security/what-is-a-
software-wallet) are the best for interacting with blockchain apps because
they are easy and free to set up, and they are often widely used on popular
blockchain apps and platforms. The most popular software wallets  today
include Metamask, Phantom, Keplr, Temple and Kukai.

While these types of wallets are extremely accessible, using them also comes
with its own risks.  To explain, software wallets store your private key on
your internet connected device, i.e. your smartphone or computer. This means
your private keys are vulnerable to online threats.

That said, there is a way to mitigate this risk: Using a Ledger device to
protect your software wallet. This keeps your private keys offline and safe
from these types of threats. For more information on how, make sure you check
out the full article on using Ledger devices with third-party wallets.

### Your Ledger Device and the Discover Section

Now, if connecting your device to a third-party wallet sounds like too much
responsibility for you to handle—don’t worry! There’s also a much easier way
to connect to blockchain apps. Connecting your Ledger device to Ledger Live
and navigating to the Discover section will present you with countless apps
and services.

Put simply, Ledger Live provides a secure gateway to popular web3 platforms
and services from different providers. Using this method, you can start to
explore web3 without worrying about phishing or malicious smart contract
functions. Ledger Live has a clear signing plugin, which guarantees that all
apps show you the proposed outcome of each transaction in human readable
language.

## Best Crypto Wallets For Buying and Selling Cryptocurrencies

Before you start interacting with web3, you might want some cryptocurrencies
first. Buying and selling cryptocurrencies can be as easy as swapping one
crypto for another. However, if you want to buy a cryptocurrency with a fiat
currency (such as dollars or euros), or sell your cryptocurrency in return for
fiat currency, you will have to use a crypto on-ramp or off-ramp service.
These on and off-ramp services are typically provided by centralized
cryptocurrency exchanges (CEXs), which brings us to our next type of wallet; a
custodial wallet.

### Custodial Wallets

Custodial wallets allow the user access to the account, but essentially the
centralized entity retains ownership over the account and everything in it.
That’s because they do not allow users the ownership of their own private
keys. Essentially, they work much like bank accounts, which makes them a good
choice for beginners. They are convenient and often designed with user-
friendliness in mind.

However, they also pose a risk. Should that centralized entity stop operating,
you may not have access to your funds. It could be as simple as that entity
going bankrupt. In fact, that’s exactly what happened with centralized
exchange Celsius. It filed for bankruptcy and none of the exchange’s customers
could withdraw their funds.

Thus, using centralized exchanges to on or off-ramp can be very convenient,
but for long term storage, using their custodial wallets isn’t the best
solution.

### On-ramps and Off-Ramp Via Ledger Live

Luckily, custodial wallets aren’t your only [on and off-
ramp](https://www.ledger.com/academy/crypto-on-and-off-ramps-say-what) option.
Through Ledger’s ecosystem you can buy and sell crypto for fiat currencies
securely using a third-party provider.

To explain, while many of Ledger’s buy partners are centralized exchanges,
using Ledger Live means you can retain custody of your keys while accessing
this important service. That means you can buy crypto with your fiat currency
then immediately secure it with your Ledger device rather than needing to
transfer it from your custodial wallet.

Within Ledger Live you can on or off ramp using several different buy and sell
providers including MoonPay, Wyre, Coinify and Paypal. Here, you can easily
buy (and sell) crypto using your regular credit card, in conjunction with your
Ledger device. Plus you can buy or sell a wide variety of coins and tokens
including Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, DOT and more.

This is the most secure way to buy cryptocurrencies, plus, you can rest
assured that using this method, only you can access the crypto in your
account.

## Best Wallets For DAOs and Organizations

If you’ve set up a web3 community with treasury funds, such as a decentralized
autonomous organization, an NFT or fan token project, you might want to
control the funds with multiple people. In fact, you might even want to set up
an account with your partner to control the funds for your next get-away.
Either way, the best crypto wallet to use when requiring multiple people’s
approval is a multisig wallet.

### Multisig wallets

[Multisig wallets](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-a-multisig-wallet)
are crypto wallets that operate via smart contracts and they require two or
more participant’s signatures to approve transactions. These types of wallets
are a game-changer for web3 businesses and communities which may require the
permission of multiple representatives in order to move money, or make
decisions on behalf of the community. Using a smart contract, you can set up
each representative to sign with their own crypto wallet— whether that’s a
software or hardware wallet like a Ledger device.

## The Ledger Ecosystem can Help You Find The Best Crypto Wallet For You

Whatever you need a crypto wallet for, the Ledger Ecosystem has an option for
you.

Firstly, Ledger devices offer unparalleled security features including; a
secure element chip, a trusted display, and rigorous security auditing in the
Ledger Donjon. Not only that, Ledger devices offer flexibility; allowing you
to set up and manage multiple accounts on multiple networks.

Then, through the Ledger Live discover section, you can access countless
platforms in a secure and decentralized way. Since you can access blockchain
apps directly through Ledger Live, you don’t have to worry about malicious
transactions or phishing attacks. Instead, Ledger Live acts as a secure
gateway to access blockchain apps and services.

Plus, if you want to explore web3 further, you can also connect your Ledger to
a range of third-party wallet interfaces, allowing you to interact with
blockchain apps beyond the Ledger Live Discover section. With this method, you
can connect to countless platforms and apps with confidence that your private
keys stay offline.

And of course, using your Ledger device along with the Ledger Ecosystem has
its main advantage: Secure self-custody. With Ledger, you can be sure that
your private keys stay under your control. In short, the Ledger Ecosystem
allows YOU to take control of your assets, because that’s what self-custody is
all about.
