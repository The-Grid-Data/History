---  
— A cold wallet is a crypto wallet that signs transactions offline and never
signs any smart contract approvals.  
  
— Cold wallets are often confused with hardware wallets, but the terms are not
synonymous.  
  
— Ledger devices offer a great option for cold storage due to their user-
friendly interfaces and industry-leading security features.  
  
The world of cryptocurrencies can feel like the wild west. Markets can react
to the slightest good or bad news and new and innovative tech comes by every
month. Transactions are instant, stakes are high and security threats are very
real.

In all of this, one thing is constant: the responsibility of storing your
digital assets safely and away from bad actors. It may seem a daunting task
with a long list of common scams targeting crypto users. However, most scams
fall into one of two categories: hacks or malicious approvals. As such, there
are now wallets designed specifically to protect you from these threats.

This is where cold wallets come in. To explain, cold wallets provide the
ultimate level of wallet security for your digital assets, by protecting you
from online threats (and sometimes even your own mistakes!)

In this article, Ledger Academy will unpack what a cold wallet is and how
setting one up can help protect your digital assets.

Let’s dive in.

## **What is a Cold Wallet?**

A cold wallet is a [crypto wallet](https://www.ledger.com/academy/basic-
basics/2-how-to-own-crypto/what-is-a-crypto-wallet) that does not connect to
the internet or interact with any [smart
contract](https://www.ledger.com/academy/blockchain/what-is-a-smart-contract).
Since cold wallets don’t connect to the internet, they are immune to online
threats like malware or spyware. Plus, isolating these accounts from smart
contracts also protects them from malicious approvals. In short, they are
simply for sending and receiving assets.

Many use the terms ‘cold wallet’ and ‘hardware wallet’ interchangeably, but
it’s important to note this is not entirely accurate. Cold wallets can come in
a variety of forms, and not all hardware wallets are cold wallets. To
understand why, let’s first dive into what a cold wallet is for.

## **What Is a Cold Wallet For?**

A cold wallet is perfect for protecting high-value crypto assets long-term
primarily due to its security features: it keeps your keys offline and
protects you from on-chain threats. Let’s see how these features work.

### **Cold Wallets keep Your Private Keys Offline**

Crypto wallets don’t store cryptocurrencies. Your crypto is stored in an
account on the blockchain, and your crypto wallet stores the [private
key](https://www.ledger.com/academy/whats-a-private-key) that allows you to
control that account. This is an important detail to understand, as the way
your crypto wallet stores the private keys of your accounts affects their
security.

For example, a software (hot) wallet, stores your private keys on a device
connected to the internet. When you sign transactions with these types of
wallets, you risk revealing your private keys to hackers via your internet
connection. To avoid these threats, cold wallets store private keys offline.
This means your account is protected from bad actors when signing
transactions.

### **Cold wallets Protect Your Assets From On-Chain Threats**

Next, cold wallets protect your assets from malicious smart contract functions
and apps. To explain, blockchain apps will require you to [sign
approvals](https://www.ledger.com/academy/ethereum-token-approvals-explained)
to use their services. For example, let’s say you want to sell an NFT on an
NFT marketplace. To execute this transaction in your absence, the NFT
marketplace’s smart contract must have your permission to move a specific
asset. This makes decentralized transactions easy as the marketplace can move
assets on your behalf.

However, signing any smart contract approval also poses a threat to your
account. Not all smart contracts have your best interests at heart, and
approving a [malicious smart contract](https://www.ledger.com/academy/smart-
contract-functions-essential-red-flags-to-know-about) could mean agreeing to
something much more sinister than selling an NFT. Most crypto scammers will
use this exact method to gain access to your funds. Believe it or not, over
[$2.7 billion](https://www.banklesstimes.com/news/2022/12/08/funds-lost-
through-smart-contract-hacks-in-2022-stand-at-
dollar27b-representing-a-1250percent-jump-
since-2020/#:~:text=According%20to%20a%20recent%20report,a%201250%25%20increase%20from%202020.)
was lost to malicious smart contract scams in 2022 alone.

A malicious smart contract can’t touch your assets unless you permit it, so
cold wallets do not connect to any smart contracts whatsoever to avoid this
risk.

## **Types of Cold Wallet**

Not all cold wallets are equal. Each type of cold wallet fulfills the primary
purpose of keeping your private keys offline but there are key differences in
security, user-friendliness, and accessibility.  Let’s see how:

### **Paper Wallets**

Paper wallets are simply pieces of paper with private keys printed on them,
typically in the form of a QR code. Users can then transact with the wallet by
sending cryptocurrency to and from the paper wallet address. Paper wallets
were one of the first crypto wallets to exist, and were popular around 2013
and 2014.

While this method keeps your keys offline, paper wallets are susceptible to
physical damage or loss. Plus there is no way to recover your keys since they
don’t use secret recovery phrases.

Not only that but transferring cryptocurrency from a paper wallet can also be
challenging. Essentially you will need to import your paper wallet into a
software (hot) wallet using your internet connection. This invalidates its
whole purpose since software wallets risk revealing your keys to bad actors
via your internet connection. Worse even, if your paper wallet falls into the
wrong hands, you can kiss your assets goodbye. The private keys are all they
need to gain access to your account.

So while paper wallets can be a cost-effective and secure way to protect your
assets,  the technical knowledge needed to manage them effectively is best
left to the experts. And today, there are plenty of cold wallet options with a
better user experience.

### **Sound Wallets**

Sound wallets are similar to paper wallets, apart from they store private keys
as audio files rather than on paper. Storing private keys on a  CD, flash
drive, or even vinyl is much more robust than paper, however, they are still
prone to physical damage. You wouldn’t want to lose access to your accounts
simply because you scratched the CD storing your private keys.

Sound wallets can also be expensive to maintain: they typically require
specific tools to decode private keys, such as a spectroscope application.
This adds a layer of complexity that is inaccessible to beginners, much like
their paper wallet counterparts.

### **Hardware Wallets**

[Hardware wallets](https://www.ledger.com/academy/crypto-hardware-wallet)
generate and store your private keys offline in a secure physical device
isolated from your internet connection. So how do they send transactions to
the blockchain?

Well unlike paper or sound wallets, hardware wallets also offer you an
interface, usually in the form of a companion app that you install on your
computer or smartphone. For Ledger devices, this companion app is [Ledger
Live](https://www.ledger.com/academy/basic-basics/ledgers-ecosystem/ledger-
live-app-buying-selling-staking-and-swapping-crypto). Using a companion app,
hardware wallets can sign transactions offline and then transmit the signed
transaction to an internet-connected device. Essentially, you can interact
with the blockchain without compromising the security of your private keys.
Plus, these types of wallets are much more intuitive and do not require
technical knowledge to operate.

Another reason hardware wallets are so popular is that they protect your
private keys from loss and physical damage. Initiating a Ledger device will
present you with a [secret recovery
phrase](https://www.ledger.com/academy/basic-basics/2-how-to-own-crypto/whats-
a-secret-recovery-phrase), a simple mnemonic that allows you to restore your
accounts using any [HD wallet](https://www.ledger.com/academy/crypto/what-are-
hierarchical-deterministic-hd-wallets) provider. So even if you lose your
physical wallet, you can regain access to your accounts by importing your
secret recovery phrase into a new hardware wallet. Plus, even if the physical
device falls into the wrong hands, hardware wallets typically protect your
assets from physical access too. Ledger devices use a PIN code which
guarantees that only the wallet’s owner can unlock the device. Plus it also
uses a cutting-edge computer chip to protect the device from physical hacks
such as side-channel attacks and glitching.

Finally, hardware wallets are the best option for setting up cold wallets due
to their capability to generate a near-infinite number of accounts, with each
account controlled by a separate private key. This feature guarantees that
signing an approval with one account will not affect the security of another.
This allows you to create multiple accounts for different purposes.

For example, you can designate one account for interacting with smart
contracts and another for vaulting your most valuable assets, otherwise known
as your cold wallet. If you sign a malicious approval with the former, the
assets in the latter will remain safe. These top-notch features mean hardware
wallets are the preferred option for cold crypto storage.

## **How To Create a Cold Wallet**

If you have a Ledger device, setting up a cold wallet is easy. All you need to
do is create a new account on your device: Ledger’s security model ensures
that your accounts stay separate from one another. As mentioned, it’s a great
idea to designate different accounts for different tasks. The aim is to
[segregate your crypto assets](https://www.ledger.com/academy/segregate-
crypto-assets); protecting accounts containing value from accounts signing
potentially malicious approvals.

 Let’s see what you need to do step-by-step.

  1. Connect your Ledger device to your computer and navigate to the Ledger Live app.
  2. Install the app of the coin you want to use. For example, if you want to protect ETH or Ethereum tokens, you need to install the Ethereum app. If you already have the Ethereum app installed you can skip this step.
  3. Next, you must create a new account for that coin. Don’t worry, even if you already have an account for that network, you can install a new and completely separate account with no issues. Your Ledger device generates a new key pair for each account.
  4. Now your cold account is ready to use, and you can even name it in Ledger Live to avoid confusion with your other Ethereum accounts. The most important thing to remember is that you should never sign smart contract approvals with that specific account. 

## **Creating a Cold Wallet Device**

If you want an extra layer of security, you can also split your assets across
multiple hardware wallets, leaving one device completely cold. This means that
you don’t sign any approvals with any account on that entire device. While
separate accounts on your Ledger are completely safe from each other,
separating your assets across multiple devices can be a great way to give you
peace of mind when traveling to crypto events. That way, you can leave your
cold wallet at home, and take the device securing less valuable assets with
you.

## **Ledger Devices: The Simplest Cold Storage Solution**

Using your Ledger device for cold storage allows you to take advantage of
[Ledger’s security model](https://www.ledger.com/academy/basic-basics/ledgers-
ecosystem/why-is-ledger-nano-so-secure). Ledger devices store your private
keys offline on a [Secure Element
chip](https://www.ledger.com/academy/security/the-secure-element-whistanding-
security-attacks), an industry-grade computer chip resistant to physical
hacks. Next, the secure element connects directly to the device’s Trusted
Display, allowing you to verify transactions in confidence before you sign.
Ledger devices also use a custom OS named
[BOLOS](https://www.ledger.com/academy/security/our-custom-operating-system-
bolos), responsible for running your separate apps on the Secure Element.

 To ensure these features keep your crypto safe, Ledger’s world-class team of
white hat hackers, [The Donjon](https://www.ledger.com/academy/security/the-
ledger-donjon), thoroughly tests each of these security elements. With Ledger,
you can manage our assets via one easy-to-use interface, Ledger Live. So what
are you waiting for? [Buy a Ledger device](https://shop.ledger.com/) and set
up your first cold wallet to start exploring web3 with security. Because
that’s what true self-custody is all about.

## **Cold Wallet FAQs**

### Cold Wallet vs Hardware Wallet: What’s the Difference?

While you can use a hardware wallet as a cold wallet, the terms are not
synonymous. Each new account you create with your hardware wallet is
technically a cold wallet. However, as soon as you connect an account to a
blockchain app, that specific account is no longer cold. Signing an approval
with an account compromises its security.

### Cold vs. Hot Crypto Wallets: What’s the Difference?

[Hot wallets, also known as software
wallets](https://www.ledger.com/academy/topics/security/what-is-a-software-
wallet), store private keys on your internet-connected device. Unfortunately,
this method comes with the risk of hacking. Your internet-connected device
could contain malware or spyware, which could either reveal your private keys
to a bad actor or tamper with your screen to convince you to sign a malicious
transaction.

Cold wallets, on the other hand, are immune to malware and spyware since they
don’t connect to the internet. They are also protected from malicious smart
contract approvals as they don’t interact with any blockchain apps or
services. To put it simply, cold wallets are specifically for protecting
assets long-term with the highest level of security.  Hot wallets are much
more suitable for making short-term purchases and should never contain
significant funds due to their security vulnerabilities.
