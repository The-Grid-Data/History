KEY TAKEAWAYS:  
---  
— Swap is one of the key ways in which crypto users can exchange their crypto
for another asset.  
  
— But swaps – like any transaction – can be a target for scammers. This is
where Ledger brings you industry-leading security.  
  
— Swapping through Ledger Live, via a third-party provider, brings you the
highest level of security as you exchange your assets: swaps are initiated
directly from your Ledger device, with your Trusted Display providing full
transparency.  
  
Swapping is one of the most popular features within Ledger Live.

In this article, we’ll take a deep dive into the mechanics of swapping through
Ledger Live via one of our third-party providers. Here, we explain exactly why
this is the most secure way to swap.

## Different Methods of Swapping Crypto

In the world of crypto, there are literally thousands of coins and tokens to
choose from. So what if you need to change one asset for another?

To do this, you have a few different options.

### Centralized Exchange

One option is using a centralized crypto exchange. Here, you’ll have access to
a wide range of options, but there are also compromises: to swap crypto here,
you will need to entrust your funds to a platform wallet, where you don’t
control the private keys.

This means you are ultimately not in control of your crypto while it remains
in this wallet. If the exchange is hacked, censored or goes bankrupt, you’ll
lose your assets.

### Decentralized Exchange

Another possibility is using a decentralized exchange, or DEX. Here, you’ll be
able to exchange one crypto asset for another, all from the security of your
own crypto wallet – where you control the private keys.But again, there is a
compromise: DEX protocols are nearly always built on a specific underlying
blockchain. This means that users are limited to swapping tokens that share
the same blockchain foundation – you could not, for example, swap ETH for BTC.

So while Decentralized exchanges provide users with more security by enabling
you to retain complete control of your private keys as you interact, the
options they offer are limited by their underlying network.

### Blockchain Bridges

Another way of exchanging one blockchain asset for another on a different
blockchain is by using a bridge.

Blockchain bridges are a type of technology that enable users to exchange one
coin for another on a different blockchain, without using an exchange. But
bridges come with their own problems. To explain their architecture, and the
fact that they are still being developed and perfected, makes them vulnerable
to hacks. This can be seen in the variety of bridge-based hacks we’ve seen
make headlines. The infamous [Ronin Hack](https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-
aftermath-of-axie-infinity-s-650m-ronin-bridge-hack), which heavily impacted
the Axie Infinity community early in 2022, to the [Nomad Bridge
exploit](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/08/02/nomad-bridge-drained-of-
nearly-200-million-in-exploit/) saw more than $200 million in crypto lost via
a malicious attack. And these are just two examples!

### Crypto Swaps

Your final option is acquiring the crypto you want via a swap. Crypto swaps
are similar to “buying” crypto. Except in this instance, you’re purchasing
your desired coins or tokens with another cryptocurrency, instead of with
Fiat.

There are some notable advantages to using swaps to acquire different crypto
assets. For a start, your range of options is not a function of any particular
blockchain. This means you can swap assets from completely different networks.

Then the other advantage of swapping is that you can engage with this
interaction directly from your own crypto wallet, offering you the maximum
possible security.

## Crypto Swaps: Explained

The principle of swapping is simple: services like Changelly are centralized
platforms that offer swaps as a service. Let’s say, for example, that you want
to swap BTC for ETH. In this case, the platform offers a “rate” for that
exchange, including a commission, and sends your crypto from its platform
wallet.

To properly understand the process, let’s take a closer look at the mechanics
of swapping. Let’s explore how swapping via one of our third-party providers
in Ledger Live helps you mitigate your risk.

## How Does a Crypto Swap Work?

A crypto swap is a transaction with two parts. One one hand, you have a
specific amount of crypto that will leave your wallet and go to the swap
provider. On the other side, the swap provider will send you the asset you
wanted in return. For example, the provider may offer to swap 0.05 BTC for 0.7
ETH.

To accept the offer, you, the user, must provide the Ethereum wallet address
where you’ll receive the ETH. Additionally, you must also send 0.05 BTC from
your BTC blockchain account to the address provided by the swap platform.

But this is where the risky bit comes into play.

## Risks of Swapping Crypto

The two biggest things to watch out for when swapping crypto is the provider
and user address. To explain, the provider address  is the blockchain address
used by the swap provider.

Then, the user address (ie your wallet address) is just as important to verify
too. If these two addresses are incorrect, you risk sending your precious
assets to the wrong person—and potentially even to a hacker.

These two pieces play a key part of man-in-the-middle attacks.

So how does this type of attack work exactly?

Well, essentially, the hacker changes the sending or receiving address to one
of their own, so that they receive the funds. Simultaneously, they will tamper
with the display of your wallet interface, so that the transaction appears
normal despite the scam. As a result, you confirm the malicious transaction in
good faith.

The result? Either your sending or receiving funds will be lost to the
hacker’s wallet.

Unfortunately, if you’re using a software (hot) wallet to make your swap,
there is no way of really knowing that either of these details is accurate.

Why? Because your digital wallet could have been tampered with via your
internet connection, but still show the “correct” transaction details on the
screen of your web2 device.

So how can you avoid this type of attack as you swap?

## For Maximum Security: Swap Crypto through Ledger Live

The most secure way of swapping your crypto is to use the swap feature within
Ledger Live. In short this powerful tool enables you to swap securely through
one of our third-party swap providers. Here’s how it works, and why it’s so
secure.

### Swap via our Trusted Swap Providers in Ledger Live

You’ll initiate your swap through Ledger Live, via one of our third-party swap
providers (such as Changelly). Once the quote is shown, you can accept the
swap and confirm the transaction. Ledger Live offers several different swap
providers, acting as a sort of aggregator for these services. Plus, you can
rest assured that when you’re using any swap provider within Ledger Live,
you’re definitely accessing the official service . To explain, Ledger Live
acts as a secure gateway to apps and services. This guarantees you don’t get
stung by phishing sites and unofficial apps.

### Benefit From Clear Signing

Another key benefit of using Ledger Live is its clear signing plugin. Firstly,
every app within Ledger Live will present you with the proposed outcome of
your transaction in human readable language. This helps you to understand the
full intent of your transaction before you hit sign.

Plus, initiating a transaction via Ledger Live also means you’ll be able to
see full and accurate transaction details on your device’s Trusted Display.
There is no other crypto wallet that can offer you this degree of transparency
or security during the process. Simpl,y swapping through Ledger Live is the
most secure option for exchanging your crypto assets.

### Secure Element: Safeguarding Your Transaction From Interference

Ledger devices also benefit from the security of the Secure Element chip. This
passport-grade computer chip stores your private keys in an environment
isolated from your internet connection, plus the chip itself is completely
tamper-proof.

As you know, each time you’re swapping crypto, hackers can intercept the
outgoing and incoming transactions. But a hardware wallet signs transactions
completely offline, meaning you can’t accidentally reveal your private keys to
the internet. Plus, even if someone were to gain physical access to your
wallet, a Ledger wallet has never been hacked—which is all thanks to the
tamper-proof Secure Element chip.

### Signature Verification and Transaction ID Verification

The swap provider will receive this transaction, and will send back their own
confirmation—that is also cryptographically signed—along with the
corresponding crypto. Secure Element verifies the signature of this incoming
transaction to ensure it has actually been fulfilled by the provider.

The ID of the incoming transaction is also checked to make sure it is the same
one you agreed to. Only that exact transaction can be executed. In short,
changing any of those details would result in a different transaction ID, and
the swap wouldn’t be completed.

## Swap Crypto Securely Through Ledger Live

There you have it: a choice of swapping options, from the security of your
Ledger device.

Crypto transactions can be tricky to grasp, but knowledge is power. Now you
understand the mechanics of swapping through Ledger Live, you have the power
to make informed choices about how you manage your crypto.

Hackers and scammers love easy targets.  So keep the hackers at bay with the
more secure option: swapping through Ledger Live.
