keys, ease of use for managing your assets, and transparency when signing
transactions.](https://www.ledger.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/11/11_Classroom_Cover_Grey-1024x432.jpg) KEY TAKEAWAYS:  
---  
  
— Ledger is most famous for creating security-focused hardware wallets, which
have never been hacked!  
  
— Ledger’s ecosystem goes much further than hardware devices, Ledger Live also
offers an ever-growing ecosystem of apps and services.  
  
— Ledger’s ecosystem provides uncompromising security, self-custody, and ease
of use: everything you need to explore the blockchain space.  
  
_If you want to know more about Ledger, here’s an introduction to Ledger and
how it provides uncompromising security for the crypto ecosystem._

## What is Ledger?

Ledger provides uncompromising security for the crypto ecosystem, offering
cutting-edge hardware wallets designed with security in mind. Ledger believes
in secure self-custody, and with a Ledger device, you can take ownership of
your private keys with confidence.

Ledger products have different features for different purposes, but the ethos
behind all of them is the same: security & ease of use. Ledger was the first
to create hardware wallets containing a Secure Element chip, and the first to
create a truly secure screen, a screen controlled directly by the Secure
Element chip.

But the Ledger ecosystem doesn’t stop with hardware. Ledger also offers a one-
stop shop companion app, allowing you to access countless apps and services
from the safety of the Ledger Ecosystem, plus, it also offers solutions for
managing crypto as a business.

To understand what Ledger is all about, let’s first dive into its history.

## The History of Ledger

Ledger has been providing uncompromising security for the crypto ecosystem
since 2015. The launch of the Ledger Nano series marked the first-ever
hardware wallet with a Secure Element chip—and since then over 7 million have
been sold.

Ledger has also evolved into a cutting-edge platform used by millions of
individuals and businesses. Ledger Live is now more than just a companion app,
it also offers a secure gateway to countless apps and services, allowing you
to buy, sell, stake, and manage your assets with ease.

Ledger has also since launched Ledger Enterprise, our branch dedicated to
businesses. Ledger Enterprise enables hundreds of exchanges and corporations
to leverage digital value with the appropriate governance and security
framework.

To bring your experience to a whole new level, Ledger teamed up with the
creator of the iPod and co-creator of the iPhone, Tony Fadell, to build the
next generation of hardware wallets. The resulting design,  Ledger Stax™, is
the first device of its kind, allowing you to manage your assets via a
cutting-edge Secure E-ink Touchscreen.

Of course, security remains the focus point of all Ledger products, from
hardware wallets to Ledger Enterprise. To guarantee the security of the Ledger
ecosystem, the [Ledger Donjon](https://www.ledger.com/academy/security/the-
ledger-donjon), our team of white-hat hackers, continuously stress-test our
solutions and look for vulnerabilities.

## Ledger Hardware Wallets

All Ledger devices benefit from [Ledger’s security
model](https://www.ledger.com/academy/basic-basics/ledgers-ecosystem/why-is-
ledger-nano-so-secure). For example, your Secret Recovery Phrase ([seed
phrase](https://www.ledger.com/academy/basic-basics/2-how-to-own-crypto/whats-
a-secret-recovery-phrase)) is generated with a random number generator, so
it’s impossible to guess or work out. Then your private keys are generated and
stored offline in a tamper-proof [Secure Element
chip](https://www.ledger.com/academy/security/the-secure-element-whistanding-
security-attacks), which keeps them safe from online and offline threats.
[BOLOS](https://www.ledger.com/academy/security/our-custom-operating-system-
bolos), your Ledger device’s custom operating system, allows your apps to
function and ensures they stay separate.

To follow, your PIN code allows your Ledger device to provide 2-factor
authentication for each transaction you make. Since you must physically
confirm each single wallet interaction on the device itself, after unlocking
it with a PIN code only you know, nobody can interact with your crypto
remotely.

These security elements are common across all Ledger devices, no matter which
you choose. But now you know a little more about Ledger devices as a whole,
let’s look at each model and the features they offer.

### Ledger Nano S Plus

![](https://ledger-wp-website-s3-prd.ledger.com/uploads/2023/04/LNSP-new.png)

The [Ledger Nano S Plus](https://shop.ledger.com/products/ledger-nano-s-plus)
is a no-brainer entry-level Ledger device. It has all the essentials to secure
your digital assets and is just as secure as any other Ledger device. It uses
the same Secure Element and custom OS as the Ledger Nano X; it’s even the same
size!

The Ledger Nano S Plus allows you to manage NFTs and fungible tokens on
countless networks too. It’s a powerful device, and also simplistic in
design—perfect for new entrants to the space.

### Ledger Nano X

The [Ledger Nano X](https://shop.ledger.com/products/ledger-nano-x) is a
mobile-first Ledger wallet for convenient day-to-day, on-the-go use. Alongside
all of the same features a Ledger Nano S Plus offers, the Ledger Nano X also
comes with Bluetooth and is compatible with iOS and Android. This
functionality allows you to manage crypto assets with your smartphone
seamlessly and wirelessly—without compromising on security.

### Ledger Stax

transparency-4-3.webp)

The [Ledger Stax ](https://shop.ledger.com/products/ledger-stax)is the first
in the next generation of crypto wallets. Ledger Stax is both easy to use and
secure; following in the footsteps of its predecessors. However, Ledger Stax
is also a lot more.

Ledger Stax was built by Ledger alongside the creator of the iPod and co-
creator of the iPhone, Tony Fadell. It features a first-of-its-kind secure
Touchscreen, powered by E Ink®. Just like any other Ledger device, the screen
is controlled directly by the Secure Element, meaning you can trust the
address details it shows.

The large screen is unlike that of any hardware wallet before it. The
touchscreen is intuitive and offers a new element of customization. To
explain, you can set any image or NFT as your lock screen and it will show
even when the device is not in use. Then, as its name implies, Ledger Stax
devices are also stackable! With their in-built magnets, you can manage more
than one Ledger Stax device and customize the whole stack!

Beyond these key features, Ledger Stax also stands out for its ease of use.
Alongside its Bluetooth functionality, Ledger Stax is also offers wireless Qi
charging; meaning no more cables needed when transacting on the go. The Ledger
Stax is just the first device in a whole new generation of crypto security
devices.

features, check out the Ledger [hardware wallet comparison

## Ledger Live

[Ledger Live](https://www.ledger.com/academy/basic-basics/ledgers-
ecosystem/ledger-live-app-buying-selling-staking-and-swapping-crypto) is the
one-stop shop for all your crypto needs, whether you want to buy, swap, stake,
or manage your assets.

Ledger Live is your Ledger device’s companion app. Once installed on your
internet-connected device, it can broadcast transactions to the blockchain and
help you visualize and manage your assets. Beyond that, it also provides a
secure gateway to countless apps and services, such as crypto exchanges, NFT
marketplaces, and more.

Accessing these platforms via Ledger Live means you benefit from [Clear
Signing](https://www.ledger.com/blog/clear-sign-your-worries-away). To
explain, Ledger Live will always present you with the full details of any
transaction in human-readable form—before you sign. This, along with your
Ledger device’s secure screen, helps mitigate the risk of making a mistake: a
common cause of lost crypto funds.

## Ledger Services

Today, Ledger’s ecosystem goes much further than its devices and supporting
providers via Ledger Live. Ledger also offers services you may be interested
in, such as Ledger Recover and Ledger Enterprise.

### Ledger Recover

[Ledger Recover](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-ledger-recover) is a
paid optional service that allows you to create a backup of your wallet
access. Hopefully, you won’t need to use it, but Ledger Recover brings you
peace of mind should you ever find yourself in an unfortunate situation.
Essentially, it gives you the freedom to retrieve access to your crypto wallet
with your ID in case your Ledger device is lost or stolen and you no longer
have your seed phrase. With Ledger Recover, you can enjoy all the benefits of
self-custody while maintaining complete control over your assets on the go.  

### Ledger Enterprise

[Ledger Enterprise](https://enterprise.ledger.com/) is Ledger’s branch focused
on helping companies store and manage crypto assets with uncompromising
security and tailored governance. While running a company with crypto sounds
like a great idea, it can be more challenging in practice. The success of your
business relies on how you handle each aspect, from managing assets securely
to setting up a governance framework to directing developers. Ledger
Enterprise simplifies the process, offering services in asset management,
staking, NFTs, DeFi, Trading, and Tokenization.

## Ledger: Offering Self-Custody and Uncompromising Security

In conclusion, Ledger is an entire ecosystem of devices, software, and
supported apps. In short, there’s something for everyone at Ledger. With the
Ledger ecosystem’s world-class security model, you can rest assured your
assets are secure. So, what are you waiting for? The Ledger Ecosystem is
ready, but the question is: are you?
