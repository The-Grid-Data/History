---  
— Smart contract functions are instructions to the blockchain. They allow us
to approve particular interactions between our wallets and third parties, like
NFT platforms and DeFi services  
  
— Many people aren’t sure how to interpret these functions – so they confirm
the transaction based on trust, without really verifying what they’re signing.
This blind spot is a huge opportunity for scammers.  
  
— Scams based on malicious smart contract approvals are on the rise! It has
never been more important to know what you’re signing.  
  
_Smart contract functions are currently the #1 way scammers are tricking
people out of their hard-earned crypto and NFTs – Don’t you think it’s time
you learned how to read them?_

Interacting with smart contracts is a non-negotiable part of Web3.  In fact,
Smart contracts power some of our best loved crypto apps and platforms and
dictate your wallet’s interaction with them. In short, they opened up the door
to a new kind of digital freedom in the decentralized world.

But with this freedom comes a heavy new responsibility. When exploring
something unfamiliar, you’re unaware of the risks involved. It’s natural for
beginners to feel overwhelmed with often complex UX and wallet knowledge
needed.

This, along with an incredible amount of value on the line, means web3 is a
breeding ground for scammers and bad actors. To be brutally honest; not every
blockchain app and platform you may come across is honest, and not all of them
are kind either.

While smart contracts are not inherently dangerous, interacting with them does
involve some risk. So what happens when you interact with a malicious smart
contract?

In this article, we walk you through some of the key smart contract functions
you’ll encounter as you interact, what they mean—and how to spot a malicious
smart contract function when you see one.

But before we get there, let’s start with the basics: What exactly _is_ a
smart contract function in the first place?

## What Is a Smart Contract Function?

Put simply, smart contract functions are pieces of code that allow smart
contracts to carry out specific actions. “Calling a function” initiates a
given interaction between your wallet and whichever web3 platform you’re
using. In other words, approving one of these functions will allow the smart
contract to carry out a specific task involving your wallet.

## Why Understanding Smart Contract Functions Is So Important

Interacting with a blockchain app means interacting with smart contracts, and
that’s why it’s so important to know a malicious smart contract function when
you see one. See—not every blockchain platform has your best interests at
heart, and some scammers will go quite far to get your hard earned digital
assets.

To cut to the point: Some smart contracts may include functions designed to
steal your assets. Using malicious smart contract functions, and a little bit
of social engineering, scammers manage to get away with countless valuable
digital assets each and every day. That’s why it’s so important to know what
to watch out for.

So, in order to navigate Web3 safely, there are a few key smart contract
functions you should be familiar with; SetApprovalForAll, SafeTransferFrom and
SendETH. Although none of these particular functions indicate you may be
interacting with a malicious contract, it’s important to know when you’d
expect to see each one.

It doesn’t stop there, though—there are many more smart contact functions to
know if you want to become a blockchain expert.

But first, let’s explore the basics of smart contract functions, and how bad
actors might use them to steal your assets.

## What Is SetApprovalforAll?

SetApprovalForAll is a function you’ll encounter fairly regularly as you
engage with Web3. You’ll most commonly see this function when you list your
NFTs for sale on a marketplace. It’s purpose is simple:_It allows that
marketplace to move your NFT out of your wallet, and into someone else’s_ ,
whenever it is sold.

Makes sense, right? But this has some repercussions too.

The **SetApprovalforAll** function may well be very common, but it’s also a
pretty risky interaction for you as a user – its scope is just so wide.

Approving this function means giving the platform you’re interacting with
access to all of the ERC20 tokens or NFTs of a given smart contract within
your wallet. Not only that, it’s an open-ended agreement, meaning it applies
to all future tokens from those smart contracts that come into your wallet.

It’s sort of like writing a blank cheque for a friend. You’re essentially
saying  “I trust this platform to do what it says it will, and to act within
the limits I’m expecting”.

As such, SetApprovalforAll is a big-hitter when it comes to crypto scams.
Thus, it’s essential to be able to identify the times when it’s safe to
sign—and when you could be interacting with a malicious smart contract.

### How To Detect Malicious SetApprovalforAll Functions

The only time you should encounter this message is when you’re**listing your
NFT on a marketplace** **or interacting with a DEX**. This makes sense, since
you need to give that platform permission to move tokens from your wallet when
they are sold or traded. But outside of these situations, seeing this smart
contract function should raise alarm bells.

Always ask yourself the question:_why am I transferring access to my tokens to
someone else?_ Thinking of it in this way makes it easier to judge whether the
transaction is legitimate.

But to keep it simple:

Minting an NFT? –**You should NOT see a SetApprovalforAll Function**

Buying an NFT? – **You should NOT see a SetApprovalforAll Function**

Swapping or Transferring an NFT? **You should NOT see a SetApprovalforAll
Function**

Signing up for an allow list? – **You should NOT see a SetApprovalforAll
Function**

Now you understand just what it means to sign this type of transaction. You’re
qualified to assess each situation where it pops up, and decide for yourself
if it’s a red flag.

## What Is SafeTransferFrom?

Another very common smart contract function you may encounter is
SafeTransferFrom. This message will appear during any transaction where you’re
sending an NFT from your own wallet to another wallet.

Let’s say, for example, you just bought yourself a Ledger, and you want to
send the NFTs from your existing hot wallet to the secure new Ethereum account
of your Ledger device. You’d see SafeTransferFrom appear on your hot wallet,
and you’d need to confirm it. In this context, a SafeTransferFrom function
makes complete sense.

The problem arises when you encounter this function in other situations –
remember, what you’re confirming here is that you want to _send_ an NFT to
another wallet, and unless that wallet is yours, there are few situations
where you’d want to do this.

### How To Avoid Malicious SafeTransferFrom Functions

So what indicates if a SafeTransferFrom approval is from a malicious smart
contract or not? Well, firstly, you should always ask yourself the
question:_why am I transferring access to my tokens to someone else?_

But to keep it simple:

Minting an NFT? –**You should NOT see a SafeTransferFrom Function**

Buying an NFT? – **You should NOT see a SafeTransferFrom Function**

Signing up for an allow list? – **You should NOT see a SafeTransferFrom
Function**

The only time you should see this function is when you are **transferring an
NFT**!

## What Is The SendEth Smart Contract Function?

If you’ve interacted with Web3, the chances are you’ve already seen the
SendEth function. Simply, it means that you’re sending Ether to another
wallet. You could be sending Eth between different wallet addresses of your
own. Or, you could be making a digital purchase on a marketplace. In these
cases, seeing the SendEth function would be completely appropriate.

![](https://www.ledger.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image-6.png)

### How To Avoid Malicious SendEth Functions

Minting/Buying/Selling/Transferring or swapping an NFT? –**You should NOT see
a SendEth Function**

The only time you should see this function is when you are **Sending ETH to
your wallet or someone else’s**!

But if you’re unlucky, you might also see this function pop up where you
_aren’t_ expecting it. During an NFT mint is a great example – here, users
believe they are minting, when in reality they are just transferring their
funds to another address.

The first thing you should check is the function call.

You can see this not just by looking at the function call (which _should_ have
said “mint” if it were truly a mint) but also by looking at the receiving
address at the top right – minting is a direct transaction with the blockchain
itself, not another wallet. So once again the presence of a receiving address
here should be another big red flag.

## Example of a Malicious Smart Contract

So what happens when you don’t identify a malicious smart contract and just
approve its function anyway?

Well, a good example of a malicious smart contract in action was with the[
Momoco](https://twitter.com/0xQuit/status/1515027650183524352?s=20&t=wuM3XrUcGVS-
JzWeBWSj7w) NFT project. This project offered a free mint for its NFTs,
driving hopeful degens to the site.

The problem? There was no mint.

When the users hit the “mint” button, it brought up a SafeTransferFrom call.
Many users approved this malicious smart contract function, incorrectly
assuming it was part of the minting process….Thanks social engineering!

Approving this function allowed the contract to transfer an NFT out of the
target wallet. There were hundreds of victims of just this single non-fungible
scam, with a single malicious smart contract.

## Malicious Smart Contracts: How To Avoid The Unknown

Remember, with smart contract function calls, the only thing that will
definitely happen is what’s written in the function box. Bad actors will try
to use social engineering to try and distract you. But remember—Any other
function than the one you’re expecting should be an instant red flag.

If you’re minting, you should see a function call for “minting”, not a
transfer. If you’re transferring, you shouldn’t see a SetApprovalForAll
function. Whatever smart contract function it is, make sure you check its
details- including checking the _type of interaction you’re confirming_ , and
the _direction of the transfer_. This will allow you to verify the
transaction, rather than trusting the circumstances.

Now that you know the meaning of these different functions, the associated
scams probably seem quite obvious. But don’t be fooled—the power of social
engineering can be pretty potent, especially when coupled with the tricky new
norms of Web3.

That’s why it’s so important to arm yourself with knowledge before you start
your journey.
