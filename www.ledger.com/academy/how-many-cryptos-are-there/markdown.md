---  
— There are multiple different types of cryptocurrency, and each one has its
own functionalities – but all of them store value in one way or another.  
  
— Crypto coins are native assets to their own blockchain. And their main
purpose is securing that network.  
  
— Tokens are developed on an existing blockchain network. They enable you to
interact with different platforms and applications within a blockchain
ecosystem.  
  
— Stablecoins and NFTs are subcategories of crypto tokens.  
  
— This is the first step on your journey into the crypto world. Let’s get to
know them better.  
  
_Now you know what crypto is, it’s time to delve a bit deeper. Just how many
cryptocurrencies are there – and what’s the difference between them all? Here,
let us explain._

## How Many Cryptos Are There?

Bitcoin may have been the very first crypto, but it’s by no means the only
one. With each generation of blockchain, new types of crypto have emerged with
different types of use cases. The cryptocurrency market currently features
over 6000 digital currencies and is constantly expanding.

![cryptocurrencies](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/z4Tn0VLgqcwQbrXfcukH9mPBOtNR8Vj-1ptnSnHAqysOIL3J-em9e5NO3YI1P8U98jONQYlVj5mCJN8SX4ZM1xridFLDMVjE88TwBk5h-RcT400LGrXDohRT8oR9athX10pA99ID7-PmtUMTV71cngTJQ44r982eqhTCo94KGBn_k176nYRwiyF1zA)

You can divide cryptocurrencies into four groups.  

  1. Coins
  2. Tokens
  3. NFTs
  4. Stablecoins

NFTs and stablecoins are subcategories of crypto tokens. However, we are going
to discuss them separately as they hold a special place in the crypto world.

### Coins

Crypto coins are built on independent blockchain networks. The defining
feature of a coin – as opposed token – is that it is a native asset to _its
own blockchain_. A crypto coin is a unit of value, used for transactions. Its
main purpose is to secure the underlying blockchain network.

Bitcoin, Ether, and Tezos are all great examples of crypto coins. Each has its
own blockchain and serves to secure that blockchain while being a unit of
value. There are currently more than a thousand coins in existence, each
fulfilling the vital function of securing its own blockchain.

### Tokens

A crypto token can also be a unit of value. But, it is created _on an existing
blockchain network._ The defining feature of crypto tokens is that they _do
not have their own underlying blockchain_.

With the help of smart contracts (we’ll come back to that), crypto-related
projects create their own tokens on top of an existing blockchain network.
Let’s take Ethereum as an example to understand tokens better.

Ethereum blockchain’s native cryptocurrency is Ether. Since Ether runs on its
own blockchain, it is a crypto coin. But it’s not the only currency that is on
the Ethereum blockchain. The key attribute of the Ethereum blockchain is that
it is programmable. In other words, developers use it for building different
projects and creating various tokens. This is made possible thanks to the
ERC-20 token standard.

## ERC-20 Token

[ERC-20 token](https://www.ledger.com/academy/glossary/what-are-erc-20-tokens)
is a standard protocol for creating tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It is a
short form of Ethereum Request for Comments, and 20 is the proposal
identifier.

Similar to how all the websites on the internet must be in compliance with
HTTP, all the tokens created on Ethereum must follow the instructions of the
ERC-20 standard. This is what allows different applications to communicate
with each other on Ethereum. You can even create a token on the Ethereum
network yourself, by following ERC-20 guidelines.

### The Ethereum Network Is Evolving

As the Ethereum network evolves, its token standard has also developed.
Various types of tokens such as ERC-721 and ERC-1155 exist on the Ethereum
network. We’ll come back to those shortly – for now, let’s look at some of the
different types of ERC-20 tokens you might encounter in the space.

### **DeFi Tokens**

Second-generation blockchains allowed us to build applications. Each
application built on a blockchain requires a token to fulfill its
functionalities. As the developers started applying blockchain to the
financial industry, a new ecosystem called DeFi emerged, bringing DeFi tokens
along with it.

A crypto token is not a native asset to its blockchain and it doesn’t support
its underlying network. However, tokens support their own economies. We can
transact tokens in exchange for goods and services on a given platform.

‘Aave’ and ‘Sushi’ are good examples of DeFi tokens, that follow the ERC-20
standard. They function as currency for their own DeFi platforms, ‘Aave’ and
‘Sushiswap’, and enable users to engage with the utility of their platforms.  

### **Metaverse Tokens  **

Another key use case of the ERC-20 token is the metaverse. Similar to how we
have a separate economy for each country, each metaverse space has its own
closed economy and its own native currency to drive it. The native currency of
a metaverse space is [metaverse
tokens](https://www.ledger.com/academy/topics/metaverse/metaverse-tokens-
everything-to-know) or “Meta tokens.”

The Sandbox is a great example. Its native currency SAND is the unit of
exchange in the Sandbox. You would need SAND tokens to access the services and
utilities of the Sandbox, and to be part of its economy.

These are just two examples of ERC 20 tokens in action, and there are
thousands more.

## ERC-721 Token

Now that you have a basic understanding of the ERC-20 tokens in the crypto
space, let’s look at another token standard – the
[ERC-721](https://www.ledger.com/academy/glossary/erc-721) – and what it
brings to the ecosystem.

### NFTs

If you’re not already familiar with the term ERC-721, let us rephrase: it’s
the technical term for an [NFT](https://www.ledger.com/academy/glossary/non-
fungible-token-nft). NFTs were first launched on the Ethereum blockchain, and
within that ecosystem, they conform to the ERC-721 token standard.

## Why are NFTs important?

NFTs are the ultimate expression of digital ownership. They enable absolutely
_any type of data_  – including art, music, gaming assets, tweets, news
articles, and rights to real-world objects – to be tokenized and therefore
owned digitally. This gave rise to a completely new and exciting type of
economy (the internet of ownership we talked about in the first article).

### NFT Use Cases

NFTs are already being used to create digital fashion, gaming assets, digital
plots of land and real estate. Creators and artists utilize them to create art
that exists fully on the blockchain. The best example of this is the famous
[“Everydays: The First 5000 Days” by NFT artist
Beeple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everydays:_the_First_5000_Days).

### **NFTs in Gaming**

If you’ve ever been a gamer, you’ll be aware that in-game assets are a big
part of the gaming ecosystem. Players would have to spend money and buy the
in-game assets for a better gaming experience. However, they can never
actually own the assets they bought and exchange them for real-time value.
Players were never able to use the in-game assets in a different game or sell
them on a marketplace for fiat money.

This scenario is changing in a big way, thanks to NFTs.

Most of the newly developed blockchain games use NFTs as in-game assets. Let’s
say you’ve bought an NFT. You can use it inside the game, exchange it for a
different asset, or sell it on a marketplace for real-time value. You actually
own the NFT. NFTs have brought a huge shift in the way the gaming ecosystem
operates.

### **NFTs in the Metaverse**

NFTs are also one of the main drivers behind the Metaverse development. Users
can “own” their digital environment, a piece of virtual land, or a property in
the form of an NFT. This adds a new layer of virtual experience that’s simply
not available in traditional gaming.

NFTs are real game changers. They are gradually blurring the boundaries
between digital and real lives by enabling us to have digital ownership of
virtual assets.

## Stablecoins

Finally, let’s talk about [stablecoins](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-
are-stablecoins).

Cryptocurrencies are known for their volatile nature and extreme price
fluctuations. Using crypto for transferring value, as an alternative to fiat
money, is impractical considering its volatility.  

This is where stablecoins come in. As their name suggests, the price of
stablecoins remains the same or stable. Stablecoins are a special type of
ERC-20 tokens. The main purpose is to leverage the pros of cryptocurrencies
and eliminate their volatile nature.

Stablecoins are able to hold a steady value because they are backed by other
assets. For example, one of the popular stablecoins tether (USDT) is tied to
the US dollar. For every USDT, an actual Dollar is kept in reserve, meaning
the value of USDT is as stable as the dollar itself. Stablecoins have come to
function as the lifeblood of the DeFi ecosystem because their stable nature is
essential for various functions of DeFi.

## Welcome to Crypto!

So there you have it – you have now completed the first chapter in your
introduction to the world of cryptocurrency!

Although it may seem like a lot of information, knowing these basic
definitions will set you up to decide what you want to get from the crypto
ecosystem, and how to access that via the coins and tokens you choose.

Crypto is your key to a whole universe of new possibilities – let’s talk in
the next chapter about crypto management, and the one essential tool you need
to manage your crypto.
