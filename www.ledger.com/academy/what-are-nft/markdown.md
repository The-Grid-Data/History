---  
— Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are unique digital assets that can represent
practically anything; including NFT artworks, in-game items for blockchain
games, web3 domains, and more.  
  
— The value of an NFT is dependent on the asset it represents, and believe it
or not, some cost more than a New York City apartment.  
  
— While NFTs were pioneered by the Ethereum network, they are now available on
multiple chains, including Solana, Polygon, Cardano, and Tezos. Even Bitcoin
has its own variant.  
  
— While minting, buying, and selling NFTs usually requires a software (hot)
wallet, to keep your NFTs safe you’ll want to protect them with a hardware
wallet. Ledger devices are perfect for protecting NFTs as they keep your keys
offline.  
  
Non-fungible tokens (NFTs)  represent a transformative force in the crypto
landscape, reshaping how we perceive and value digital assets.

 The origin of NFTs can be traced back to 2014, although they exploded into
popularity much later in 2021, specifically with the introduction of the
ERC-721 token standard on the Ethereum network. This breakthrough made
creating non-fungible tokens much easier, opening the door to new ideas from
less tech-savvy creators. In short, it allowed digital artists to create and
distribute their own NFT collections. This sparked a whole creator economy,
cutting out the middlemen that typically dominate artistry in the physical
world.

But since then NFTs have transcended their roots, permeating various
industries beyond art. Digital creators, including musicians, game developers
private members clubs use NFTs as a way to monetize their crafts. But before
we dive into the details, what are NFTs exactly?

## What is a Non-fungible Token (NFT)?

A non-fungible token, or NFT, is a blockchain token with a unique value. They
can represent anything, from digital collectibles to membership cards to in-
game items and metaverse land. The possibilities are almost endless.

But to understand fully, let’s start with fungibility. To explain, a fungible
item can be replaced with another identical unit. A good example of something
fungible is the United States Dollar, or in fact, any fiat currency. One
dollar is always worth one dollar, whether it comes in the form of a note or a
coin, thus dollars are fungible.

NFTs are non-fungible because you can’t swap one for another identical copy:
each token has a different value. Think of each NFT as a painting from a
famous artist. Despite using the same materials, the same brushes, and having
been painted by the very same hand, no two pieces of work have the same price.
That’s basically how NFTs work too: their value depends on what they offer and
how much the buyer is willing to pay.

To understand what gives them value, let’s take a look at some of the use
cases of NFTs so far.

## Types of NFTs: What are NFTs For?

Of course, as a representation of something unique, NFTs can come in many
forms and have a near-infinite number of use cases. However, these are some of
the most common uses for NFTs so far:

### NFT Artwork

One of the most popular uses of NFTs is as a distribution method for digital
art. Since these tokens are unique, they can represent unique pieces of
digital art. This allows digital artists to distribute their works themselves
through decentralized NFT marketplaces. NFTs also allow you to build
conditions that guarantee creator royalties.

Plus, since the blockchain is decentralized, NFT holders truly own their
pieces of artwork. Using a [non-custodial
wallet](https://www.ledger.com/academy/glossary/non-custodial-wallet), only
you have access to your accounts, meaning your artwork is only yours to enjoy.
With these benefits, there is now a thriving crypto art culture consisting of
many notable digital artists including Beeple, Fewocious, and Justin Aversano.

### NFT Collectibles

NFT collectibles have been extremely popular since their explosion into the
mainstream in 2021. While NFT collections such as CryptoKitties and
[CryptoPunks](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-are-cryptopunks-nfts) were
around for much longer than that, this era defined the rise of NFT
collectibles.

While there are many ways to launch a collectible project, one of the most
popular formats is a “10k collection”. Typically these collections will have a
set of attributes, such as bodily parts on a base character, which will be
chosen at random to guarantee each NFT is unique. This type of collection was
pioneered by the CryptoPunks but later made famous by the Bored Ape Yacht
Club. Since then, there have been countless collectible drops with every theme
imaginable.

### Web3 Domains

NFTs are not all about showing off art or collectibles. They are also useful!
Using NFTs, several protocols now offer you the chance to mint your own web3
domain.

Essentially, a web3 domain allows you to personalize a crypto account. Setting
up a web3 domain will allow others to send you crypto without copying down
your blockchain address. This is great for helping your friends find the
correct account and avoiding any potential mistakes copying down blockchain
addresses. Web3 domains also make up a part of your [digital
identity](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-digital-identity)!

Popular web3 domain services include [ENS
domains](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-ethereum-name-service-ens) and
unstoppable domains on the Ethereum network. Then there are also [Tezos
Domains](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-a-tezos-domain), offering .tez
addresses for the Tezos network.

### In-game Assets

NFT can represent in-game items for blockchain games, such as weapons, power-
ups, vehicles, characters, and more. This is a game-changer for gamers. In
traditional games, buying a digital item means giving a centralized game
studio your funds. If you don’t want to play that game anymore, the digital
item stays within the platform and your money is long gone.

But when your in-game items are NFTs, you can sell them to someone else and
use those funds to buy items for a game you still play. Plus, when you buy an
in-game item, you’re paying the creator of the item rather than a centralized
company, helping power the decentralized creator economy.

Not only that but since NFTs operate using smart contracts on decentralized
networks, you can also program them to have interesting functionalities. For
example, using the item could burn (destroy) the NFT, or lock it up using a
cool-down timer until it can be used again.

### Metaverse Land

Another interesting use of NFTs is to represent parcels of land in [blockchain
metaverses](https://www.ledger.com/academy/nfts/virtual-worlds-on-the-
blockchain-welcome-to-the-metaverse). Most blockchain metaverses offer a
limited supply of land plots. Typically, they will also allow you to build
what you’d like on your property, whether that’s creating a digital experience
or using it for advertising. They encourage user-generated content and even
let you monetize your plot.

Good examples of metaverses offering land as NFTs include [The
Sandbox](https://www.ledger.com/academy/the-ultimate-guide-to-the-sandbox-
metaverse), [Decentraland](https://www.ledger.com/academy/decentraland-
metaverse-explained), and [The
Otherside](https://www.ledger.com/academy/topics/metaverse/what-is-the-
otherside-metaverse).

## How do NFTs work?

NFTs work differently on different chains, but typically they rely on smart
contracts. For more complex or data-heavy NFTs, they may also use an off-chain
data storage system. Let’s see how these pieces work.

### Smart contracts

[Smart contracts](https://www.ledger.com/academy/blockchain/what-is-a-smart-
contract) are at the core of most NFTs. In short, they provide the framework
for executing functions automatically—without a middleman. But they don’t just
power NFTs, they are also responsible for the operations of all sorts of
blockchain apps including NFT marketplaces and DeFi platforms.

Smart contracts are essentially just computer programs, but instead of running
on one computer, they operate using a blockchain’s network of nodes. To do so
they require a virtual machine. That’s why Bitcoin doesn’t have smart
contracts: Bitcoin doesn’t have its own virtual machine.

Ethereum, on the other hand, uses the [Ethereum virtual machine
(EVM)](https://www.ledger.com/academy/topics/crypto/understanding-ethereum-
virtual-machine-evm). While it was built specifically for Ethereum, many
chains now use the EVM, which means many NFTs across multiple networks follow
the [ERC-721](https://www.ledger.com/academy/glossary/erc-721) or
[ERC-1155](https://www.ledger.com/academy/glossary/erc-1155) smart contract
standard. This allows developers to build projects on multiple chains with
ease. In some cases, it also allows for some level of interoperability.

### Data Storage

Although your NFT is stored on the blockchain, that doesn’t mean all of its
data is too. While some NFT collections store their data on-chain, this can
become costly and can cause network congestion for some blockchains. Minting a
high-quality image directly on the blockchain requires a lot more data storage
than some simple text. To avoid exorbitant fees to mint and transfer these
more complex NFTs, many projects opt to host their images using decentralized
data storage services.

Some examples of these services include Arweave and
[IPFS.](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-ipfs) Using these services, you
can mint an NFT with a link to the asset hosted off-chain. This lessens the
burden on the chain. However, some will argue that these NFTs are less
decentralized and immutable, as typically the person who initiates the off-
chain storage will have the power to change the image linked to the NFT.

## NFTs on Different Crypto Networks

Today, there are NFTs on countless networks; far too many to list here!
However, below you’ll find some of the most popular networks for NFTs
currently.

### NFTs on Ethereum

[Ethereum](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-ethereum) was the first
crypto network to support NFTs. Since its launch in July of 2015, its
ecosystem of apps has only increased. While NFTs have been possible since
Ethereum’s launch, they catapulted into popularity around 2021.

Building upon the ERC-721 contract pioneered by CryptoKitties, variants of
this smart contract have emerged, allowing for new capabilities. Take the
ERC-1155 contract, for example, which introduced a way to create semi-fungible
tokens. These types of assets were a game-changer for in-game items, allowing
you to create multiple copies of a token whilst retaining programmatic
capabilities.

There are also several experimental contract standards such as; ERC-721a which
reduced the gas fees needed to mint large batches of NFTs, and ERC-404, which
allows for native fractionalization.

Today, the Ethereum network is still the most popular chain for NFTs, hosting
some of the biggest NFT collections. Cryptopunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club, and
Moonbirds are all Ethereum collectibles. Ethereum also supports some of the
biggest decentralized metaverses such as Decentraland and The Sandbox.

### NFTs on Solana

The first NFT project on the [Solana
network](https://www.ledger.com/academy/blockchain/what-is-solana) launched in
2021 and was named Kreechures. In short, it is an RPG that uses NFT characters
you can level up. Since then, Solana NFTs have come a long way, with
collections thriving across multiple genres. Some of the biggest NFT projects
you will find in the Solana ecosystem now include Frogana, Claynosaurz, and
STEPN.

### NFTs on Tezos

The NFT ecosystem on Tezos is mainly geared towards artists and individual
creators. As such, the chain has attracted a lot of upcoming digital artists,
particularly in the generative art niche. For example, one of the most popular
generative art platforms, fxhash, launched on Tezos.

Minting NFTs on the Tezos network is much cheaper than on most networks, and
there’s a huge ecosystem of participating creators. Not only that, but there
are a range of Tezos NFT marketplaces to choose from.

### NFTs on Bitcoin

Although it doesn’t support smart contracts, the Bitcoin network has a couple
of alternatives to NFTs. [Bitcoin
ordinals](https://www.ledger.com/academy/bitcoin-ordinals) were first
introduced to the network in 2023 via the Ordinals Protocol. Created by Casey
Rodarmor, this protocol allows you to inscribe pieces of Bitcoin with rich
data such as text or images.

Then, there is also the [Bitcoin STAMPS
protocol](https://www.ledger.com/academy/glossary/bitcoin-stamps). In short,
these Bitcoin assets are much like Ordinals, apart from all of their data
being stored on-chain. However, it’s important to note that neither of these
protocols allows for self-executable functions. So while you can create a
token similar to an NFT on the Bitcoin network, they are not quite the same.

## Crypto wallets for NFTs

If you want to manage your NFTs, you’ll need a crypto wallet. Bear in mind
that wallets are usually chain-specific and even when they work with multiple
chains, you may need to check if they support NFTs too.

### Software (Hot) Wallets for NFTs

Typically, interacting with a mint or NFT marketplace will require a software
wallet, also known as a [hot
wallet](https://www.ledger.com/academy/topics/security/what-is-a-software-
wallet). These types of wallets are free and easy to use. They are also most
people’s first type of wallet. Popular examples of software (hot) wallets
include MetaMask, Phantom, and Rabby.

However, it’s important to note that using a software wallet alone also comes
with a risk: allowing hackers to access your accounts. To explain, software
wallets store your [private keys](https://www.ledger.com/academy/whats-a-
private-key) on their host device, i.e. your computer or smartphone. These
types of devices are vulnerable to malware due to their constant connection to
the internet, thus trusting them with valuable assets is a no-go. To benefit
from their connectivity while keeping your private keys (and thus your assets)
safe, the best solution is to connect your hardware wallet to a software
wallet. This allows you to get the best of both worlds.

### Hardware Wallets for NFTs

[Hardware wallets](https://www.ledger.com/academy/crypto-hardware-wallet)
store the private keys to your accounts offline, completely separate from your
smartphone or laptop and its internet connection. While software wallets risk
revealing your private keys via your internet connection during the signing
process, hardware wallets sign transactions offline in a tamper-proof
environment. As remote hacking attempts are rife in the industry, hardware
wallets are an invaluable piece of kit.

If you need to use a software wallet to access a web3 platform or service,
it’s recommended you use it in tandem with a hardware wallet. Luckily, Ledger
devices are compatible with a wide range of software wallets across multiple
chains. For example, for the Ethereum network, you can [connect your Ledger to
MetaMask](https://www.ledger.com/academy/security/the-safest-way-to-use-
metamask). Then for Solana, you can connect your Ledger to Phantom. Ledger
devices even connect to wallets capable of storing Bitcoin Ordinals, such as
Leather (Hiro) wallet.

With these two pieces of tech working together, managing NFTs is seamless—and
it doesn’t require forfeiting your custody or security.

## The Future of NFTs

Today, you can find NFTs on multiple chains, each with its own ecosystem of
marketplaces, minting sites, and NFT-compatible wallets. In some cases, NFTs
operate across multiple networks too.

In short, NFTs are an integral part of the crypto ecosystem. With their wide
range of use cases, they offer new and innovative ways to activate
communities, create digital identities, and provide benefits for their users.
From novel uses like in-game items to more serious use cases like web3
domains, NFTs have changed the course of crypto history.

But of course, with the growing ecosystem of NFTs comes new challenges, namely
avoiding hacks and scams. That’s why protecting your NFTs with a security-
focused wallet is so important. Luckily, Ledger offers the tools you need to
keep your non-fungible assets safe. With a Ledger device, you can avoid online
threats, such as malware; and physical threats, such as physical hacking. This
is thanks to [Ledger’s security model](https://www.ledger.com/academy/basic-
basics/ledgers-ecosystem/why-is-ledger-nano-so-secure), comprising cutting-
edge hardware components such as the Secure Element chip it uses to store
private keys offline. Plus a Ledger device’s capability of generating a near-
infinite number of accounts lets you [segregate your crypto
assets](https://www.ledger.com/academy/segregate-crypto-assets) into accounts
designated for different tasks, allowing you to protect your main holdings
from potentially malicious smart contract functions.

In short, a Ledger device is the single tool you need to access the NFT
ecosystem with security and peace of mind. So what are you waiting for? Get
yourself a Ledger device and start protecting your NFTs with secure self-
custody—because if not self-custody, then why use crypto in the first place?

## FAQ

### How to Transfer NFTs

Just like standard ether (ETH) and [Ethereum
tokens](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-are-erc-tokens-and-why-do-we-use-
them), NFTs can be transferred from one address to another. But it’s important
to note that the transaction fee is always paid in Ether since NFT tokens are
usually indivisible by nature and cannot be used to pay [gas
fees](https://www.ledger.com/academy/blockchain/what-are-gas-fees).

### How to buy and sell NFTs

To buy and sell NFTs, you will need to use an [NFT
marketplace](https://www.ledger.com/academy/nft-marketplaces-explained). There
are countless NFT marketplaces to choose from, but typically they are only
compatible with a limited number of blockchains. For example, Magic Eden
supports Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon NFTs; plus it also supports Bitcoin
Ordinals. Then if you want to buy or sell Tezos NFTs, you’ll need to use a
Tezos-specific NFT marketplace such as Objkt.

Of course, you’ll also need to use an NFT-compatible wallet to connect to
these platforms, typically a software wallet. As you likely already know, the
best way to ensure your security is to connect your hardware wallet to this
account, thus protecting your private keys (and your assets along with them).

### How to create an NFT

To create an NFT you’ll need to either write a smart contract, get someone to
write a smart contract for you, or use an NFT minting service. If you’re
inexperienced, the latter is your best option; and luckily you have plenty of
options to choose from. Most NFT marketplaces, including OpenSea, Magic Eden
and Nifty Gateway, offer a minting service. However, it’s important to note
that the fees to mint on each platform will vary, as will the type of NFTs you
can create and the chains they are compatible with. If you want to know more,
make sure you check out our full guide on [how to create an
NFT](https://www.ledger.com/academy/topics/nfts/how-to-create-an-nft-drop).

### What is an NFT allowlist?

An NFT allowlist is a method of creating an exclusive group of people
permitted to mint NFTs from a specific project. Essentially it’s like a
digital guestlist, only allowing certain people to access a contract. If you
want to understand the inner workings of the process, check out the full
article on [allowlists](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-an-allow-list).
But to keep it brief, it’s a way to bring more exclusivity to an NFT project,
prioritizing holders of particular NFTs or those that complete certain tasks
over the general crypto population.

### Why are NFTs Valuable?

NFTs are unique and thus can vary in their rarity, desirability, and utility:
their values rely on speculation, supply and demand, and several other
factors. Like collectibles in the physical world, NFTs are worth as much as
somebody is willing to pay for them—which can be a considerable sum. Famously,
Beeple’s “Everydays: The First 5000 Days” sold for a whopping $69.3M; with
only the Merge by Pak eclipsing those figures since, selling for $91M in 2021.
