---  
— Coins are any cryptocurrency that has a standalone independent blockchain
(Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple…)  
  
— Tokens are digital assets that operate on an existing blockchain network
instead of on their own. This gives them some interesting properties relating
to interoperability.  
  
— Coins and tokens may seem similar but there’s a lot more to know under the
hood; Together, they have built the basis of DeFi, a thriving digital art
scene and even decentralized governance.  
  
  
Entering the cryptocurrency market can be a complicated and daunting task. You
may have heard of Bitcoin, but what about the other thousands of coins and
blockchain projects out there? How do they work and are they all the same?

Well the answer is no, they are not all the same at all. While many
cryptocurrencies offer the same core feature: a peer-to-peer transfer of
monetary value, the purposes of different coins and tokens can vary greatly.
But before we get into the specifics of different purposes of digital assets,
let’s first start with the primary purpose of their creation: as an exchange
of monetary value. Or more precisely, as currency.

This key use-case has built the base of the cryptocurrency market as we see it
today. The core tenets of blockchain technology, transparency, provenance and
immutability, have the power to change the financial market as we know it.  In
short, there would be no DeFi without coins or tokens.

On a very simple level, coins offer the basis of a secure network, while
tokens allow for blockchain apps and platforms to build upon that base. But
there’s a bit more to it than that.

Let’s explore what crypto coins and tokens are in the first place.

## Crypto Coins and Tokens: What Are they?

Crypto coins and tokens are digital assets primarily used for monetary
transfer, or as a store of value. Put simply, they are both currencies using
blockchain technology at their base. But that’s largely where the similarities
end. In fact, the tech behind coins and tokens are quite different.

Without getting too technical, coins are the native currencies of specific
blockchains. For example, BTC is the native coin of the [Bitcoin
network](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-bitcoin). On the other hand,
tokens are currencies (or digital assets) supported by a specific blockchain,
rather than powering their own.

To see how this works in action, let’s explore each of these types of assets.

## What Are Crypto Coins?

Coins refer to any [cryptocurrency](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-
cryptocurrency) that has a standalone, independent blockchain — like Bitcoin.
Put simply, if the cryptocurrency runs on its own blockchain, then it is a
coin. This native coin is what you use for paying transaction fees and
participating in the network. This native coin is what network participants
receive in return for keeping that network secure.

To explain, coins provide the necessary basis of a blockchain network’s
security model. As you might already know, blockchains require crypto
[miners](https://www.ledger.com/academy/bitcoin-mining-what-is-it) or
[validators](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-a-blockchain-validator) to
secure the network and process transactions. But creating a decentralized
blockchain isn’t as easy as it sounds. Miners and validators put in work to
secure blockchain networks, and as a result, they require an incentive.

For example, on a [proof-of-
work](https://www.ledger.com/academy/blockchain/what-is-proof-of-work)
blockchain, miners must solve complex mathematical equations which take an
incredible amount of computational power. This requires specialized equipment
and can consume a lot of increasingly expensive energy. On a [proof-of-
stake](https://www.ledger.com/academy/blockchain/what-is-proof-of-stake)
network validators must lock up huge amounts of funds as collateral in a
process called [crypto staking](https://www.ledger.com/academy/basic-
basics/keep-growing-it/stake-your-crypto).

Since the network needs participants, but processing transactions involves
hard work, the security of a network relies on its incentivization structure.
Since public blockchains are decentralized, coins are an integral part of this
security model, as miners and validators must have an incentive to keep the
system running.

Beyond those initial use cases, each blockchain may have differing use-cases
for their native coin though. Each network has its founder and some have
completely opposite use-cases.

## What Are Crypto Coins For?

Let’s start with the most popular crypto coin as of yet, Bitcoin. This coin
exists as a censorship-resistant store of value and medium of exchange that
has a secure, fixed monetary policy. The native token of Bitcoin, BTC is the
most liquid cryptocurrency in the market. It has both the highest market cap
and realized market cap in the cryptocurrency sector. Bitcoin is used as a
store of monetary value often dubbed “digital gold”, since it is secure and
extremely decentralized.

However, other coins have been created for different reasons. All non-bitcoin
coins are named “altcoins” but don’t let that fool you: They don’t all serve
the same purpose.

So how do crypto coins work in practice? Well, [Ripple
(XRP)](https://www.ledger.com/academy/crypto/what-is-ripple) coin was created
specifically to aid the traditional banking system, and therefore follows a
more centralized model than Bitcoin. Then you have
[stablecoins](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-are-stablecoins), offering a
way to transfer the value of a fiat currency using the security of a
blockchain. A good example of a stablecoin is USDT, a cryptocurrency version
of the United States Dollar (USD).

But it’s not all about serious financial instruments. You also have more
frivolous coins, such as [memecoins](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-are-
memecoins). A good example of a memecoin is
[Dogecoin](https://www.ledger.com/academy/the-backstory-dogecoin). In this
case, the coin’s only purpose is to represent a meme or piece of popular
culture.

In short, not all coins are secure, not all coins are decentralized and, in
fact, some coins don’t have a solid purpose at all. The only feature that
links them is being a native coin of a blockchain network, but more often than
not, they serve a purpose as some kind of currency.

![Coins](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_lrVJFIWU7izqEF3JTvC5i_rRtLrGACnnv_vnKHA0RLRPL7z61C1zzxwrOr8LwQ9rmz_pgFCJsV6YI4VrhQ5kx9BuA2HZXnx-
eJkcJVt0mj04xKbQM3m6dx17QsJfXOMVQBqvP0fOaemgUkZP1JCfdDt8LZICD0SHFT2SHpAwRSbaGQmtH20taQgJxBJFQ)

## What Are Crypto Tokens?

So now you know about native coins, but what about crypto tokens?

Put simply, tokens are currencies (or other types of assets) supported by a
specific blockchain, but they aren’t the native coin of the network. If that
sounds complicated, let’s dive into how that works in practice.

The [Ethereum network](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-ethereum) is the
second most popular blockchain in existence and it also supports the most
tokens out of any other blockchain so far. While the Ethereum network’s native
coin is Ether, it also supports lots of other Ethereum-based currencies that
follow a specific standard called the ERC standard. To explain, there are
multiple currencies (and other assets) on the Ethereum network that are not
Ethereum’s native Ether and each of those assets are known as tokens.

The first token offered by the ERC standard was the [ERC-20
token](https://www.ledger.com/academy/glossary/what-are-erc-20-tokens). In
short, this fungible token standard allows users to create, issue and manage
currencies supported by Ethereum. It actually fueled the ICO craze of 2017,
with countless projects launching their own tokens on the blockchain. Since
then, the standard has only expanded, adding [ERC-721
tokens](https://www.ledger.com/academy/glossary/erc-721) (non-fungible tokens)
and [ERC-1155 tokens](https://www.ledger.com/academy/glossary/erc-1155) (semi-
fungible tokens) too.

A good example of an [Ethereum token](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-are-
erc-tokens-and-why-do-we-use-them) is SAND, the currency of blockchain
metaverse, [The Sandbox](https://www.ledger.com/academy/the-ultimate-guide-to-
the-sandbox-metaverse). This ERC-20 token lives on the Ethereum network,
however, its primary purpose is as an in-game currency in the Sandbox game.

The reason the Ethereum network can support tokens is due to its [smart
contract](https://www.ledger.com/academy/blockchain/what-is-a-smart-contract)
compatibility. To clarify, the ERC standard allows you to deploy smart
contracts that allow for fungible or non-fungible tokens. In other words, you
can create your own cryptocurrency or digital asset without launching a whole
blockchain yourself.

But tokens aren’t just for the Ethereum network. Today, multiple blockchains
support fungible and non-fungible tokens, such as
[Solana](https://www.ledger.com/academy/blockchain/what-is-solana),
[Cardano](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-cardano) and
[Tezos](https://www.ledger.com/academy/topics/blockchain/what-is-tezos).

## What Are Crypto Tokens For?

Well, like crypto coins, there are multiple use-cases for crypto tokens. On a
simple level, tokens can help blockchain apps and platforms to enable users to
pay for specific services or fees. But there’s a bit more to it than that.

### Blockchain Apps Driven By Smart Contracts

Since smart contracts allow for digital asset transfer with conditions, tokens
can have in-built rules. This means tokens can involve conditions relating to
their distribution, transfer or even involving instructions directing to other
tokens or protocols. This core functionality led to the creation of tokens
with extra abilities coins weren’t previously capable of. Using smart
contracts, tokens can have specific [burn
functions](https://www.ledger.com/academy/token-burning-what-is-it-why-do-it)
or conditional events attributed to them, creating a unique experience for
their holders. In short, [dapps](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-a-
dapp) and blockchain apps became a reality thanks to smart contracts and the
tokens issued using them.

### DeFi

Many blockchains are decentralized, and smart contracts allow for
interoperable tokens and self-executing code. Using these two innovations,
[decentralized exchanges](https://www.ledger.com/academy/crypto/what-is-a-dex-
decentralized-exchanges-explained) went from pipe-dream to reality. This
created the core basis of [DeFi](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-defi)
as we know it today. Put simply, smart contracts allow the easy creation of
digital assets which are all interoperable on a specific network. This means
that swapping, lending and transferring these tokens is much easier and more
secure than swapping different crypto coins. So naturally, their innovation
opened the door to platforms capitalizing on this interoperability.

A great example of this is Uniswap, a completely decentralized and automated
crypto exchange. It uses UNI as its native token, an ERC-20 supported by the
Ethereum blockchain. On Uniswap, fees and services are payable in UNI. And UNI
is easy to swap with any other ERC-20 token, just like the SAND we mentioned
earlier.

But it’s not just exchanges either, tokens also made way for more complex
platforms supporting swapping, lending, and even [crypto
derivatives](https://www.ledger.com/academy/crypto-derivatives-what-are-they-
all-about). You can even buy tokenized real-world assets on the blockchain
today. Yes–that’s right. There are crypto tokens that represent precious real
world assets such as gold or silver too. These types of tokens are just the
tip of the iceberg.

### Utility

Some tokens are created as financial instruments and some without any reason
at all, but some tokens serve a single purpose as part of a specific project
or ecosystem. These are known as [utility
tokens](https://www.ledger.com/academy/glossary/utility-token), and they are
responsible for all sorts of different ways web3 communities run or present
themselves.

Some utility tokens may act as in-game currencies, whereas others may be
awarded as part of a loyalty scheme when using a specific company. Another
popular use case for utility tokens is as decentralized voting instruments in
[DAOs](https://www.ledger.com/academy/blockchain/what-is-a-dao). There are
endless possible use cases for utility tokens. Who knows, you might come up
with the next best use-case yet.

## Understanding Coins Vs Tokens

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/LYX4GztDNd6n43qU8nogbF8q_hqdIMcMDHopTNcyVVQm_mkVBu6shPQH8G-y0I_cyA0j8z-O2lUZR_Oyxh9vEvGhr2XSC-8kL68W17IQ-
fvpUj87TBz3heRb_N2EKlSQztkgQef2GArvuP6fDjK7_WikC8n79CaY7cEJglg9OvOcuYgLXb4QyjAHoPcctg)

Crypto coins and tokens have a variety of use-cases and there is, of course,
some crossover, with both coins and tokens having their uses as an exchange of
value. This means that when analyzing them, you’ll often look at similar
metrics; their use, active holders, value, allocation, market capitalization
and so on. But that’s largely where the similarities end.

See, coins are integral to the security of a blockchain and incentivize
participant’s good behavior. They tend to be less volatile than tokens, and
also less frivolous—but that’s not always the case. If you’re analyzing coins,
it’s always clever to look at the technical side of how the network operates,
such as its [consensus mechanism](https://www.ledger.com/academy/consensus-
protocols-how-are-blockchains-secure). This gives you an insight into where
that native coin is going, and whether the participant responsible for
processing transactions is doing so effectively.

Tokens, on the other hand, provide purpose and utility to the network’s users,
promoting the network’s growth in relevance and users. While that may sound
trivial compared to security, each of these assets play a valuable role.

Tokens are much quicker and easier to launch than coins. This means they are
more than sufficient for temporary or singular use cases. But don’t don’t
underestimate them for being easy to launch. Believe it or not, some tokens on
the Ethereum chain have grown so far that they outweigh many coins with their
own entire networks. ERC-20 token DAI is a great example of this. Even as an
Ethereum token, DAI has far surpassed the [Avalanche
Network](https://www.ledger.com/academy/topics/crypto/what-is-avalanche-avax)
in terms of market cap.

But of course, you can’t have tokens without coins. These two assets work in
tandem to create a better decentralized experience for everyone. For
decentralized peer-to-peer transfer of digital assets, you will need to rely
on the native coin of a blockchain network. Then to benefit from
interoperability, you’ll need to use tokens. Put simply, the question of coins
or tokens depends very much on the specific use-case and the blockchain you
want to use.

## Crypto Coins and Tokens Vs Traditional Finance

While cryptocurrencies may seem overwhelming at first, it’s undeniable that
blockchain technology is making the whole concept of “being your own bank”
completely possible. With the innovation of tokens, cryptocurrencies are not
just useful as a store or transfer of value, but also as financial instruments
such as derivatives and representations of tangible assets too.

The difference between these assets in traditional finance and DeFi is
ownership. While your bank doesn’t give you true ownership of any of the
assets you store in your bank account, your crypto wallet is built a little
differently. Using a non-custodial wallet, you retain the ownership of the
assets in your account. That means that whether you want to lend your crypto
tokens or use them as collateral to borrow funds yourself, or even create a
decentralized [blockchain game](https://www.ledger.com/academy/nfts/the-
top-5-blockchain-games-you-can-explore), only you have custody of your assets.
This is clearly much more favorable than forfeiting your ownership to a
centralized company. Imagine the centralized company (or bank) you trusted
with your funds closes down, In this instance, your funds might be at risk.

If you want to start lending, borrowing and more, then why trust a service
that retains custody over your assets? Using blockchain technology, as long as
you have a [non-custodial wallet](https://www.ledger.com/academy/glossary/non-
custodial-wallet), saves you this worry.

With Ledger’s ecosystem you can store and manage both coins and tokens with
confidence they are secure while retaining ownership. You can even lend,
borrow and access countless blockchain apps directly within [Ledger
Live](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live), meaning you don’t need to forfeit
custody of your keys to start exploring.

The future of finance is decentralized, and using each of these important
digital assets, and understanding how they work, will give you the edge when
holding or trading cryptocurrencies.
