![Purple warning sign on a black background.](https://www.ledger.com/wp-
content/uploads/2021/11/08_Scams_Cover_Purple-1024x432.jpg) KEY TAKEAWAYS:  
---  
— Malware can easily be installed on a computer or smartphone by using a link
in e-mails, banners or text messages without its victim noticing it.  
  
— This gives the attacker total control over the rights of the computer or
smartphone – a common crypto hack.  
  
— If your private keys are stored online or on your smartphone, it means your
crypto funds are at the whims of what the attacker chooses to do with them.  
  
— Hardware wallets totally mitigate these risks: they protect the seed from
software and physical attacks. A malware installed on a smartphone cannot
retrieve the seed stored by a hardware wallet.  
  
_Self-custody means being your own security – so the more you know about
scams, the better. Let’s discuss this common crypto hack._

  
While physical tampering of a smartphone requires an additional layer of
complexity (i.e., physical theft), malware is the more appealing option to a
hacker. In many cases, malware is more intimidating than that annoying
software that slows down your web browser. The attacker exploits
vulnerabilities in the operating system to install a malware.  

## What is malware?

Malware is a type of software program that is concealed by seemingly innocuous
links in emails, banner ads, and text messages. One way for an attacker to
install malware is to use social engineering techniques: the victim is tricked
into installing a malicious piece of software on her computer (i.e. she clicks
on a link and accept to install something). Another way is for the attacker to
exploit the vulnerabilities in a software, such as a web browser, used by the
victim: this will allow the attacker to install malware without the consent of
the victim.  

![](https://www.ledger.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Article-2-Malware-
principle.jpg)

## What Can Malware Gain Access To?

The attacker can wield such vulnerabilities to give them total control over
the rights of the smartphone or computer, accessing the library of sensitive
data in the process. The malicious actor can also reset accounts (e.g., Google
Office Suite) using control of the computer. User crypto funds are, as a
result, at the whims of what the attacker chooses to do with them if passwords
and private keys are stored in these online accounts.  

While it may give some hope that passwords aren’t always stored, the attacker
can reset the password of the application/account (only need email access to
validate the new password). Then, to transfer all funds to his own address,
the attacker will initiate a send. Validation of the transaction will require
a 2FA, sent by SMS. If the hacked device concerns a smartphone, he can access
the SMS and transfer all cryptocurrencies to his accounts.  

![](https://www.ledger.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Article-2-Exchange.jpg)

## Different forms of malware

Numerous forms of these types of malware are continually lurking as successful
crimes until their eventual discovery — such as recently with the fake crypto
trading software UnionCryptoTrader.dmg [caught infecting Mac OS
machines](https://www.coindesk.com/new-mac-malware-hides-in-memory-and-
masquerades-as-a-crypto-app).  

The daunting part of these attacks, and why they are so difficult to detect,
is that they operate silently in the background of the computer or smartphone.
Users very rarely know something is wrong until their funds are missing.

## Malware in Crypto

In the case of the UnionCryptoTrader.dmg vulnerability, the malware was
“fileless.” It embedded itself in the memory of a device — never interacting
with files or drives. This enables the malware to evade many software
applications designed explicitly to detect malware via interaction with
drivers or files.  

The combination of socially engineering employees of crypto exchanges with
embedded malware into email links (called phishing attacks) is also a
potential vulnerability of some cryptocurrency exchanges.  

Notably, some exchanges have [thwarted attempted
hacks](https://www.coindesk.com/coinbase-says-it-foiled-a-sophisticated-
hacking-attack) that deployed such a method earlier this year where hackers
attempted to gain access to employee emails and passwords via phishing
malware. Still, the high-profile string of successful crypto exchange hacks
exposes how not all exchanges have been so deft in their cybersecurity
practices.

Just because phishing malware attacks may not be prevalent among exchange
hacks doesn’t mean they should be overlooked from a risk perspective. Threats
toward crypto exchanges and users will likely become more sophisticated as
security measures adapt to multi-pronged approaches.

Hybrid attacks need concurrent responses to multiple security holes, including
trust in a third-party. For users, it is never guaranteed that assets stored
on an exchange are safe, and so you should take necessary precautions to avoid
doing so.  

That’s where hardware wallets come to the rescue: Don’t trust, verify.  

## Hardware wallets mitigate the risks

Hardware wallets alleviate this type of crypto hack by interposing an
additional barrier to the release of crypto funds from your wallet. User
assets cannot be sent from a [Ledger
device](https://shop.ledger.com/pages/hardware-wallets-comparison) unless the
user physically connects the device to the computer and verifies the
transaction on both the computer _and the device_. If malware is controlling
your device, it cannot control your Ledger wallet, even when it is plugged
into the computer.  

![](https://www.ledger.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Article-2-HW-cant-be-
control-or-hack.jpg)

Hardware wallets protect the seed from software and physical attacks. A
malware installed on a smartphone cannot retrieve the seed stored by a
hardware wallet.  

Important to remember: if the addresses on the computer/phone and the hardware
device do not match, you may be experiencing a hacking attempt. Your hardware
wallet is showing you the true details of the transaction you are about to
send. The physical hardware device is significantly more difficult to
compromise than your computer that is vulnerable to the caprices of the public
Internet, and is your primary defense against this type of crypto hack.  

Combined with [2-FA](https://www.ledger.com/fido-u2f/) and multi-signature
protocols by exchanges, “cold storage” that uses hardware wallets is the most
popular storage method for the vast quantity of exchange and custodial
reserves for a reason. It should be a prudent investor’s choice, as well.  

Hardware devices are guardians against both physical and digital tampering —
other storage options do not provide such security measures.

### Knowledge is power.
