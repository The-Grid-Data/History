KEY TAKEAWAYS:  
---  
— To retain custody over your crypto assets, you’ll need to use a non-
custodial wallet, such as Metamask or Ledger. However, the security of non-
custodial wallets can vary greatly.  
  
— Software wallets such as MetaMask remain connected to the internet, whereas
hardware wallets, such as Ledger, store private keys in an isolated
environment.  
  
— Software and hardware wallets aren’t in competition; you can use them
together for the best user experience while retaining your security.  
  
_If you’re exploring blockchain apps and platforms in the wonderful world of
web3, you’ve probably heard about Metamask._

With its orange fox logo, MetaMask is one of the most popular crypto wallets
today, and certainly the most famous hot wallet so far. However, to use
MetaMask securely, it’s good practice to use it in combination with a hardware
wallet such as a Ledger device.

But before we get there, let’s dive into the basics. In fact, what is MetaMask
all about?

## What Is MetaMask?

MetaMask is a non-custodial software crypto wallet that operates cross-chain.
To explain what that means, let’s break that down.

So firstly, MetaMask is non-custodial: it allows you to control and manage
your own private keys. Unlike a bank or a wallet on a crypto exchange,
MetaMask does not have any power over the funds in your account. As long as
you’re the only one with access to those private keys, you are the sole owner
and manager of your account.

Next, it’s cross-chain. MetaMask allows you to manage accounts on multiple
networks, including [Ethereum](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-
ethereum), Binance Smart Chain, and
[Polygon](https://www.ledger.com/academy/blockchain/what-is-polygon-matic).
Specifically, MetaMask supports [EVM
chains](https://www.ledger.com/academy/topics/crypto/understanding-ethereum-
virtual-machine-evm), and may even branch out to other networks in the future.

Finally, it’s a [software
wallet](https://www.ledger.com/academy/topics/security/what-is-a-software-
wallet), also known as a hot wallet. It operates purely via software you
download and install on your web2 device, such as a smartphone or laptop. It
stores your private keys on that host device, which is very convenient for
sending transactions to the blockchain. However, this feature also impacts
your security. To understand how you can mitigate this risk, let’s first dive
into what MetaMask is for.

## What is MetaMask For?

MetaMask was designed for interacting with blockchain apps and smart contracts
including DeFi platforms and NFT Marketplaces. To explain, most decentralized
applications ([dApps](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-a-dapp)) and
decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols only support a few different wallets,
and often, MetaMask will make that shortlist.

There are countless blockchain apps and platforms you can connect to with
Metamask, with almost too many features and genres to name, but here are a few
things you can do using MetaMask:

  * Borrow or [lend crypto](https://www.ledger.com/academy/lend-your-crypto) coins or tokens
  * Buy, sell, and trade on [NFT marketplaces](https://www.ledger.com/academy/nft-marketplaces-explained)
  * Play [blockchain games](https://www.ledger.com/academy/nft-gaming-and-play-to-earn-explained)
  * Start [yield farming](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-yield-farming)
  * Trade and swap on [Decentralized Exchanges](https://www.ledger.com/academy/crypto/what-is-a-dex-decentralized-exchanges-explained)

## MetaMask Crypto Wallets: How To Mitigate Risks

But as with any good thing, using MetaMask comes with some risks.

Essentially, software wallets, including MetaMask, generate and protect your
private keys on your host device, such as your smartphone or laptop.
Unfortunately, your web2 devices are not designed to store private keys, and
thus using a crypto wallet on these types of devices may leave you vulnerable
to online threats. Since your web2 device connects to the internet and is
vulnerable to malware, you can’t always trust its screen. Plus, signing a
transaction also poses a risk as your web2 device risks exposing your private
keys via your internet connection.

For these reasons, MetaMask also
[recommends](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-
us/articles/360015489591-Basic-Safety-and-Security-Tips-for-Metamask) you use
a hardware wallet in conjunction with its software wallet if you own a
significant amount of crypto. Luckily, you can use your Ledger device in
tandem with your MetaMask wallet to get the best of both worlds. Yes, you can
combine the Web3 agility of MetaMask with the offline security of a hardware
device.

## Why You’d Want To Use MetaMask with Ledger

In general, using a [hardware wallet](https://www.ledger.com/academy/crypto-
hardware-wallet) is the most secure way to store the private keys. That’s
because they store your private keys and sign transactions offline. This
guarantees that no one on the internet can access them. Connecting an account
on your Ledger with a Metamask wallet allows you to protect your private keys,
sign transactions offline, and still access all of the apps and platforms you
want.

Essentially it provides you with a physical
[U2F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_2nd_Factor). To clarify, you
will need to physically connect your Ledger device to your computer. Then you
will have to confirm every transaction on the physical device each time you
initiate it through MetaMask. As you can guess, this makes the hackers’ job
quite difficult. This is what makes using the [combination of MetaMask and
Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/metamask) so secure.

## How To Set Up Metamask To Connect To Ledger

First, get yourself a [Ledger hardware
wallet](https://shop.ledger.com/pages/hardware-wallets-comparison) to
safeguard your private keys. Ledger devices come with a companion app called
Ledger Live (available on mobile & desktop), providing you with a safe gateway
to all your crypto services and downloadable for free.

From there, you’ll also need to install MetaMask. You have two options: either
you install its browser extension, compatible with Chrome, Firefox, Brave, and
Edge, or its mobile app.

Make sure you download the wallet from the official Metamask website though,
as fake wallet apps are well-known scam that could target you.

Once you have those elements sorted, you’re ready to begin. Here’s a step-by-
step guide on how to set it up:

  1. Open Ledger Live and Click on “Accounts” on the left-hand side.
  2. Create your Ethereum account by clicking ‘Add an Ethereum account’
  3. Open Metamask to set up a new wallet. Here you’ll then face an important question: **create a new wallet** or **import an existing wallet.** Here, opt to **create a new wallet**. We’ll explain why below.
  4. Approve the next page: this relates to sharing data with MetaMask
  5. Create a password when prompted on the page that follows: this will be your login credential for each time you want to use MetaMask going forward.
  6. On the next screen, you’ll receive the recovery phrase words for your MetaMask wallet. Once you’ve confirmed that you’ve seen and recorded this phrase, your MetaMask set-up is complete.

### Which Seed Phrase (Secret Recovery Phrase) Do I use?

You might be wondering at this point what the difference is between the
MetaMask seed phrase and the one you received when you first set up your
Ledger device.

The answer is pretty simple. Each phrase acts as a master key to a separate
set of addresses on the blockchain. The difference is that your Ledger seed
phrase has never been exposed online, while you can’t say the same for any
software wallet seed phrase.

To explain, software wallets generate, store, and manage your seed phrase
while connected to the internet. So if you have revealed it to a bad actor,
you won’t know until they access your wallet. That’s why it’s always best
practice to avoid keeping valuable assets in any wallet storing your keys and
seed phrase on an internet-connected device. Instead, you should protect these
sensitive pieces of information with your hardware wallet, and leave all of
the interface and connectivity jobs for your software wallet.

So how do we use these two wallets together while benefiting from the best
features of both?

## How To Connect Your Ledger To Metamask

With that all clear, let’s walk through the steps of how you can connect
Ledger to MetaMask, to enjoy seamless transactions while your keys stay
entirely offline.

**Step 1.** Connect your Ledger device to your computer device using a USB
cable. Also, open your MetaMask wallet in full screen on your browser. You can
do this by logging in with the password you just set up.

![](https://www.ledger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pasted-image-0.png)

**Step 2:** Click on the top-right menu of the MetaMask wallet and then find
and click on “Connect Hardware Wallet” in the drop-down menu.

![](https://www.ledger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/unnamed.png)

**Step 3:** When you click “Continue,” MetaMask will look for a Ledger device
connected to the computer. So, to make sure it discovers your wallet, unlock
your Ledger device.

![](https://www.ledger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pasted-image-0-1.png)

**Step 4:** Once it discovers your wallet, it will prompt you to choose a
Ledger account that you would want to connect to MetaMask. Choose an existing
account or create one in [Ledger Live](https://www.ledger.com/academy/the-
power-of-ledger-live) and choose that.

**Step 5:  ** Click on the “Ethereum application” on your device display then
click on “settings” and turn on “blind signing” (please make sure you’re aware
of the risks associated with blind signing). Or else it won’t work properly.

**Step 6** : Open the MetaMask window, click on the account logo in the top
right corner, scroll down to “settings” and click. Then click “advanced
settings”, scroll down, and turn on “WebHID”.

Voila! This will enable you to view your Ledger wallet balance on your
MetaMask extension or mobile app. You will also be able to transact across all
blockchain applications that support MetaMask. The only thing you will need is
to connect your Ledger wallet to your device open Ledger Live, verify and sign
the transactions.

**Step 7** : Enjoy your ride: you can now interact with your favorite dApps
with the security of your hardware wallet.

If you’re having any trouble or feel a bit lost, this [support
page](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020871157-Connection-
issues-with-MetaMask-?support=true) might be of help.

As of 2024, you also have the option to connect your Ledger Nano X to MetaMask
Mobile! To learn more and start connecting your wallets for prime ease of use,
[check out the support page.](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-
us/articles/16748796611613-How-to-pair-and-connect-your-Ledger-Nano-X-to-
MetaMask-mobile-app?docs=true)

## Metamask and Ledger: Accessible and Secure

If you want to explore the wonderful world of web3, you’ll want to do so with
style and security. With the MetaMask browser extension or mobile app, you
have access to a plethora of blockchain apps and services, including all of
the top DeFi platforms, countless NFT marketplaces, and even NFT minting
platforms. MetaMask is one of the top most supported wallets in the web3
ecosystem.

Then the [Ledger Security model](https://www.ledger.com/academy/basic-
basics/ledgers-ecosystem/why-is-ledger-nano-so-secure) guarantees that its
devices and software work seamlessly. Your Ledger device protects your private
keys in an isolated environment, away from your internet connection and the
remote attack vector it represents. And of course, their cutting-edge physical
components mean Ledger devices are resistant to physical hacks too. In short,
your Ledger device is all about security, and your MetaMask wallet is all
about connectivity. The cherry on top is that you can use these wallets
together to get the best of both worlds.

So what are you waiting for? Download MetaMask and protect it with your Ledger
Device to interact with web3 apps and platforms with self-custody and security
on your side.
