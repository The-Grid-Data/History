![The app allows you to check your balance anytime and anywhere. It gives you
visibility and control over your funds.](https://www.ledger.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/11/11_Classroom_Cover_Main-1-1024x432.jpg) KEY TAKEAWAYS:  
---  
— Ledger Live app provides a wide range of services. It allows you to buy
different crypto assets, swap crypto, cash out your preferred coins, and grow
your funds.  
  
— Ledger Live enables you to access and manage your NFTs from within the
Ledger ecosystem.  
  
— It allows you to access DeFi services like swapping, staking, lending, and
borrowing securely, with no blind signing, via integrated Web3 apps.  
  
In the last article, you learned about the specialized components of your
Ledger device, and how these protect your private keys from both physical and
digital threats. Now let’s address the next pillar of Ledger’s infrastructure:
the Ledger Live App, where your crypto portfolio comes to life.

The Ledger Live App is a management interface that pairs with your device. It
allows you to visualize and manage your entire crypto and NFT portfolio, all
in one place. Ledger Live comes with every Ledger device it’s available on
both mobile and desktop, giving you a clear, intuitive interface to manage
your digital assets. Let’s take a closer look at what it offers you.

## Easily Manage Your**** Crypto Assets

Ledger Live enables you to securely manage a wide range of cryptocurrencies,
including NFTs, coins and tokens, as well as access a variety of crypto
services. This way, you can easily keep track of your crypto operations and
check your real-time balance.

### Buy and Sell Crypto

Buying and selling crypto are two essential parts of the crypto experience,
and you can do both from within the security of the Ledger ecosystem. You can
buy your first digital assets, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum with our
providers: [MoonPay](https://www.moonpay.com/),
[Transak](https://transak.com/), Ramp, and more.

And if you think you want to cash out and sell some of your digital assets,
you can do that too.

## Ledger’s App Catalog Explained

The blockchain ecosystem is expanding quickly, and Ledger is a secure gateway
to the entire space and all of the services it offers. One of the most
important parts of that is Ledger’s App Catalog.

The [App Catalog](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-
us/articles/4404599625233-Discover-Live-Apps?docs=true), within the Discover
tab of Ledger Live, is a searchable list of Web3 apps integrated to work
directly with your Ledger device. [Ledger Live
apps](https://www.ledger.com/academy/discovering-ledger-live-apps) also
benefit from a clear signing plugin. That means your transaction details with
those platforms can be viewed in full on the Trusted Display of your Ledger
device. This means no more [blind
signing](https://www.ledger.com/academy/enable-blind-signing-why-when-and-how-
to-stay-safe) when you access those applications via Ledger Live – instead,
you’ll have absolute clarity on what you’re agreeing to, before you confirm.
This is a huge advantage for you as you explore Web3.

## Access DeFi: Swap, Stake, Lend and Borrow

[DeFi](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-defi) is one of the most
interesting – and well-developed – areas of Web3. Services can be broadly
categorized into four categories: swapping, staking, lending and borrowing,
and all of these are available with full clear-signing transparency via apps
on Ledger Live.

### Swapping with Ledger

[1inch](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-paraswap) and
[Paraswap](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-paraswap) – two of the most
widely used [decentralized
exchange](https://www.ledger.com/academy/crypto/what-is-a-dex-decentralized-
exchanges-explained) aggregators in the DeFi space. This means you can swap
your crypto directly from within the security of your Ledger device.

### Staking with Ledger

Staking enables you to participate in the operations of a blockchain’s network
and get rewards for your contribution. You can put your idle coins to work
with Ledger Live which is now integrated with
[Lido](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-lido), the top staking platform
for Ether (ETH).

### Lending and Borrowing with Ledger

If you’re looking to lend your crypto in exchange for some rewards or borrow
some crypto yourself thanks to DeFi –
[Alkemi](https://www.ledger.com/blog/say-hello-to-alkemi-earn-lend-and-borrow-
crypto-without-leaving-ledger-live) is at your fingertips. In short, no matter
which of DeFi’s exciting options you want to access, you can do it all from
the security of your Ledger device, with full and certain knowledge of what
you’re signing – and that’s thanks to Ledger Live.

## Manage NFTs in Ledger Live

NFTs go beyond fungible assets like tokens and coins, adding a personal
element to your crypto portfolio via their unique nature. But as assets based
on smart contracts, they entail some new considerations for wallet providers –
visualizing your collection tended to be one of those limitations.

NFT management on Ledger Live is different. Here, you can secure, visualize,
and transact with your NFTs, all from within the Ledger Ecosystem. So if NFTs
are your passion, securing your collection with a Ledger device is not only
the safest option – but also makes for the best user experience currently
available.

## Ledger Live App: a Secure Gateway to Web3

Your Ledger device is not just a hardware wallet. It provides you with a
secure ecosystem to manage your assets, visualize your portfolio and safely
explore all of the options Web3 has to offer.
