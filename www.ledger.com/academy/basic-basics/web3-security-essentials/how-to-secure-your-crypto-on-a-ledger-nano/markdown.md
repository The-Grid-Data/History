---  
— Private keys are your essential link to your blockchain assets; offline
storage is the best way to secure those keys.  
  
— Most entrants to Web3 start out using a software wallet – but later opt for
a hardware device that secures their keys offline, and isolated from hackers.  
  
— But the way you make the transition from software to hardware storage is
incredibly important – getting it wrong means your hardware device will not
protect your assets.  
  
— Every asset you migrate needs a completely new address within the hardware
device – with private keys that have never been online.  
  
Since you started this course, you’ve learned the basics of Web3, of
blockchain, and of crypto security. There’s just one thing left to do before
you begin actively exploring the space: learn exactly how to secure and
migrate crypto assets using a hardware device. Let’s tackle that process.

## The First Step in Crypto: Secure Your Private Keys

Whether it’s Bitcoin, Ether, NFTs, or a brand new token from a project you
just started backing, all of your crypto assets have one thing in common –
they ALL have a private key.

If you are you’re looking to secure and migrate crypto on a Ledger device, you
might think this simply means recovering your private keys on your device. But
doing this would be a huge mistake.

In this article, Ledger Academy explains how to properly migrate crypto assets
into a secure hardware wallet.

## Software Wallets Should Always Be Secured by a Hardware Device

A hot wallet, or software wallet, may well conceal your private keys, in the
sense that they’re stored within the interface and you won’t need to write
them down. But managing your keys within an interface on a connected device
leaves a gap for sophisticated digital hackers to target your data.

### Once Online, Always Online

Once your keys or recovery phrase have been online, even for a second, they
are no longer safe. Anyone might have accessed them remotely. There is simply
no way of knowing.

From here, one thing should be clear: if your private key started its life
online, simply moving it into a hardware wallet will not make it safe.

What you need is a new key that has never been on internet-connected devices.

## Migrate Crypto From Your Software Wallet to a Ledger

The entire premise of a Ledger device is that it keeps your private keys
completely offline. This is the central proposition of a hardware wallet. But,
what the device _cannon do_ is protect keys that have already been online.

Never use your seed phrase to recover a hot wallet on a hardware device. Doing
this may well recover your existing blockchain assets, but it won’t secure
them.

### 1) Create a New Address for Each Asset

If you’re looking to migrate crypto assets from a hot wallet to a Ledger
device, you should create a new address altogether. This should be the case
for every one of your different crypto assets, and you can find out how to do
it [right here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5xOTsFrwtI)

### 2) Verify and Send Each Crypto Asset to its New Ledger Address

The next step is sending each one (that means some gas fees) from your
existing wallet into its new account within your Ledger device. You’ll be able
to see your public key (receiving address) by copying it from the Ledger Live
App. You’ll need to verify on the Trusted Display of your Ledger device to be
sure.

### 3) Enjoy Completely Secure Private Keys

With your new private keys generated within the device, and your assets sent
to their new address, your crypto is now secured in a totally offline
environment.

With this done, you can switch off and be absolutely certain that your assets
are untouchable via a hack.

## Can I Still Interact With dApps From My Ledger?

The answer is yes! Ledger’s ecosystem of integrations is constantly expanding.
It enables you to interact with dApps safely from your hardware wallet.

Even if you’re interacting with a platform that’s not yet integrated into
Ledger’s ecosystem, don’t worry -you are still covered. Ledger devices are
fully compatible with key Web3 middleware. We’ll talk you through the process
of connecting your Ledger to a Web3 browser extension right[
here](https://www.ledger.com/academy/security/the-safest-way-to-use-metamask).

## You Are Now Web3-Ready

Congratulations! With your course completion, your blockchain knowledge up to
the mark, and your private keys tucked away in a hardware wallet, you are now
ready to safely explore Web3.

If you take just one thing from this course, it should be this: keeping your
crypto safe is not only about protecting your private key and recovery phrase.
While also _understanding the space,_ in order to avoid the pitfalls.

Things move quickly in the Web3 space, which is exciting! But scams also
evolve quickly. And the freedom of self-custody means that it’s completely
your responsibility to protect your keys and funds.

That’s why Ledger’s mission is not just to provide the safest storage solution
for your private key, but also the best ongoing educational resource where you
can constantly stay up to date on the latest risks to your crypto.

In Web3, ‘you’ are in charge. So get secure, stay educated and enjoy the ride!
Ledger will be here to support you.
