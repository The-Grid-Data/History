![Crypto wallets hold your private keys and allow you to manage your
blockchain assets.](https://www.ledger.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/11/11_Classroom_Cover_Purple-1024x432.jpg) KEY TAKEAWAYS:  
---  
— Private keys define the ownership of crypto assets. But they can be
difficult to manage and secure.  
  
— Anyone can access your blockchain address once they have the corresponding
private key. Hence keeping it secure is essential.  
  
— Crypto wallets hold your private keys and allow you to manage your
blockchain assets.  
  
If you’re new to crypto and you’re wondering how crypto wallets work – and why
you need one – you’ve come to the right place. Crypto can seem like a steep
learning curve. Trust us – doing this essential groundwork, and properly
understanding how blockchain assets work, will set you up for success (not to
mention security) as you embark on your crypto journey.

Crypto is simply a form of value that exists on [the
blockchain](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-blockchain). Put simply,
blockchain is a digital ledger that keeps track of digital assets and, in
fact, that’s where your crypto is really stored. The only way you can access
the funds at a specific blockchain address is with something called a [private
key](https://www.ledger.com/academy/whats-a-private-key). This private key
corresponds to your address within the blockchain. It gives you control of
that address and the value stored there, and you can spend or exchange it when
you want. Your crypto wallet is the link between you and your private key.

Thus, understanding what crypto wallets do, and what they are for is essential
in managing your own digital assets.

## What Is a Crypto Wallet?

Put simply, a crypto wallet is an interface that allows you to access and
manage your funds on a blockchain. It acts as a sort of control panel, showing
you exactly how much crypto you have. Plus, it allows you to communicate with
the blockchain, sending and receiving valuable digital assets. You might say
that your crypto wallet is the bridge between you and your crypto funds on the
blockchain.

However, despite the name, a crypto wallet does not contain your coins or
tokens – those stay on the blockchain itself. Rather, its purpose is to secure
the all-important private keys that allow you to access your blockchain
address, and everything stored there. To understand how that works, let’s
first look at what a crypto wallet is for.

## What Is a Crypto Wallet For?

Your crypto wallet exists purely to protect your private keys whilst giving
you access to them. These private keys give you access to an address for
sending and receiving cryptocurrency. They also offer the interface you will
use to verify your identity, access specific tools, communities, and more. If
you want to take part in [crypto trading](https://www.ledger.com/academy/how-
to-trade-crypto), [DeFi](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-defi)
platforms, or even [NFTs](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-are-nft), you’re
going to need a crypto wallet.

### But, Why Do We Even Need Crypto Wallets in the First Place?

To explain, a private key in raw form, is a scary-looking string of 256 1s and
0s. For a crypto user, storing this private key is both risky and impractical.
To explain, anyone with your private key can access all of your funds.

For example, writing your private key down is an insecure way to store it. All
it takes is one person to see this number, and all your crypto is gone. What
if you have multiple crypto accounts? You’d need to write and store the
private key for each one, amplifying the chances of somebody seeing this
precious piece of information and understanding what it means.

Even storing it on your computer poses a risk. Remember: any device that is
connected to the internet is at risk from hackers and malware. This means that
storing your private key on your device also makes it vulnerable to hacks.

So, to interact with the blockchain safely and easily, you need to manage
multiple keys at once, and must allow you to transact without ever revealing
the keys to any other parties. And this is exactly what a crypto wallet is
for.

## What Types of Crypto Wallets Are There?

There are different kinds of crypto wallets: Software, hardware. Some – like
exchange wallets – are custodial. But what does that mean exactly?

Let’s explore each of these further:

### **Custodial Wallets**

A custodial wallet is usually issued by a centralized exchange, and it does
not give you full control over your funds. In short, the exchange keeps hold
of the private key that grants true ownership to your assets.

Exchange wallets are custodial, which means that instead of trusting YOU with
your own private key, the exchange itself holds it on your behalf. Instead,
what you’ll get is login credentials for the platform, and this is how you’ll
access your wallet. These platforms allow you to recover your account at ease,
but it comes with a price – the cost of true ownership.

Storing your cryptocurrencies in a custodial crypto wallet is like parking
your car in someone else’s garage. Even though you own the car, the key to the
garage is with the garage owner. In case, when the garage owner doesn’t share
his key with you, you’ll not be able to drive your car around despite owning
it. This is a pretty accurate analogy for exchange wallets.

### **Software Wallets**

A [Software wallet](https://www.ledger.com/academy/topics/security/what-is-a-
software-wallet), more often known as a hot wallet, operates as software on a
host device and they store your private keys within its interface. Mostly,
these wallets are non-custodial, meaning they give you custody of your keys.
However, they store your private keys on an internet-connected application on
your phone or laptop and this is a risk.

These devices are always automatically connected to the internet, which makes
them very convenient. You simply need to log in to begin interacting with
online applications via the wallet interface on your computer.

However, this also means the keys to your crypto are always online – this
means a hacker can use your personal device and connection as a vector for
accessing your private keys remotely. The most common way crypto users get
scammed is via a hacked device. So having a hot wallet might be easy, but it
doesn’t offer the security you might want.

So with that in mind – how exactly _DO_ you keep those keys away from hackers
dwelling online?

### **Hardware Wallets**

A [hardware wallet](https://www.ledger.com/academy/crypto-hardware-wallet) is
a physical device that stores the private keys to your cryptocurrency funds
away from the internet. Even if you make transactions with it, the wallet
confirms the transactions in an [offline
environment.](https://www.ledger.com/academy/how-can-you-sign-online-
transactions-when-your-private-key-is-offline) This process helps keep your
private keys away from the risks of the internet at all times.

Furthermore, hardware wallets are non-custodial wallets. You are the only one
who owns access to your private keys and funds. Thus, when you use one, you
own the private keys associated with your cryptocurrencies. If you take crypto
security seriously and understand the novel risks faced by this type of asset,
you’ll know that this type of storage is the only truly safe option.

Hardware wallets are often called [cold
wallets](https://www.ledger.com/academy/hardware-wallets-and-cold-wallets-
whats-the-difference), but this isn’t accurate. A cold wallet might not be
hardware (there are other varieties), and not every hardware wallet is “cold”.
Instead, a cold wallet, beyond keeping your private keys offline, goes a step
further by never interacting with smart contracts or Web3 platforms. Avoiding
signing smart contracts negates the risk of your wallet signing a malicious
transaction, which puts the contents of your wallet at risk even if your keys
are offline. The purpose of a cold wallet is purely for “vaulting” assets. To
learn more, check out the Ledger Academy article on how to [segregate crypto
assets.](https://www.ledger.com/academy/segregate-crypto-assets)

## What Is The Safest Crypto Wallet?

If you’re looking to protect your crypto, the only real option is buying a
hardware wallet. This way, you can retain custody of your assets and keep your
private keys safe- and offline.

Ledger devices are some of the most secure crypto wallets in existence,
securing your private keys with a [Secure Element
Chip](https://www.ledger.com/academy/security/not-all-chips-are-born-equal).
This component is used in a variety of secure environments such as credit
cards, passports, and payment systems. Renowned for bringing the highest level
of security to any system where sensitive data is managed. This means that,
beyond keeping your private key offline and away from hackers, the Ledger
device itself is also completely impenetrable from external threats, thanks to
the state-of-the-art components inside.

If you actively trade cryptocurrencies Ledger is a great option. Not only due
to its incredibly secure hardware wallets, such as the [Ledger Nano and the
Ledger Stax](https://shop.ledger.com/pages/hardware-wallets-comparison), but
also because of its companion app [Ledger
Live](https://www.ledger.com/academy/the-power-of-ledger-live), a software
that enables you to easily manage your assets from your desktop or mobile.
Ledger is the gateway to all your crypto needs, safely.
