![With no central authority, there is no customer support to fall back on, and
no way to get your crypto back if you make a
mistake.](https://www.ledger.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/11/11_Classroom_Cover_Main-2-1024x432.jpg) KEY TAKEAWAYS:  
---  
— Crypto is vulnerable to specific hacks, threats, and scams due to existing
digitally.  
  
— With no central authority, there is no customer support to fall back on, and
no way to get your crypto back if you make a mistake.  
  
—**** Protecting your crypto is 100% your responsibility. This means
understanding the specific threats you face and making sure you have the right
tools and knowledge to keep them out.  
  
So far, you’ve learned about blockchain security essentials: crypto wallets,
private and public keys and the all-important recovery phrase. But one thing
remains in the shadows – _what exactly are you securing your crypto from?  _

Here, we take a deep dive into crypto security threats, so you know exactly
what you’re dealing with.

## How Does Crypto Get Stolen?

“With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility”. That might sound familiar to
you but it’s not advice purely for Spiderman; Crypto comes with similar
obligations. [Cryptocurrencies](https://www.ledger.com/academy/how-many-
cryptos-are-there) provide us huge freedom compared to fiat money. But, this
new and unfamiliar environment is also much more vulnerable to threats, and
there are a couple of reasons for that.

Firstly, an unfamiliar ecosystem means new threats you may not have seen
before. And secondly, since cryptocurrencies don’t use a central authority or
bank, there’s no customer support if you make a mistake.

Self-custody means taking total responsibility for your funds.**You** are the
gatekeeper. So, understanding how crypto scams work is essential.

### Digital Threats To Your Crypto

As you already know, most crypto-threats target you via your internet
connection. There are a couple of different approaches they might take. Let’s
discuss them.

**Hacks to Your Connected Device** :

Hackers from anywhere on the planet can target you silently, via your internet
connection.

That can be a problem if you are using a software wallet to manage your
[private keys](https://www.ledger.com/academy/whats-a-private-key).

When you use a wallet that exists as an interface on your computer or phone,
your private keys are always connected to the internet. The security barriers
of a software wallet may not be enough to prevent clever hackers from
accessing your private keys. With the right technological know-how, a good
hacker might be able to penetrate the wallet and reach your keys.

**Phishing** :

Malicious links are another very common way for hackers to penetrate your
crypto security. They are effective because they don’t look like a threat –
how many links have you clicked this week yourself? Maybe dozens or more.

A malicious link can look as innocent as this:

[clickthislink.com](https://www.ledger.com/academy/enter-the-trust-zone/all-
about-scams)

When you click on the wrong link, hackers will be able to remotely access your
computer or device. Doing so enables a few different possibilities: they can
extract your private keys from your software wallet, tamper with the interface
of your device to manipulate your transactions, or even search the saved files
of your device for sensitive data such as your recovery phrase.

In short, whether it’s hacking or spyware, your internet connection is a
vector for bad guys to access your sensitive data. This is why it’s extremely
important to ensure that both your private keys and [recovery
phrase](https://www.ledger.com/academy/basic-basics/2-how-to-own-crypto/whats-
a-secret-recovery-phrase) are stored completely offline.

And these are not the only scams your crypto is vulnerable to.

### Social Engineering Scams

While some scams target weaknesses in your security set-up, others target
weaknesses in _your judgment_. Social engineering scams create a fake
situation where you feel “safe” to confirm a transaction. Doing so means you
can be manipulated into giving a bad actor access to your wallet.

For instance, scammers might pose as “customer service agents”, offering you
help on a trading platform or similar. In order to assist you, they might say
they need you to share your recovery phrase, or ask you to confirm a “message”
(which is really a malicious transaction) on your wallet to prove you’re the
owner.

Either way, it’s a scam – and the reason scams like this are so effective is
that you, the victim, have built some sort of rapport with the other person
over the course of the interaction.

It takes surprisingly little to create a feeling of trust – but trust is not
enough when it comes to your hard-earned value.

### Blind Signing (A Combination Threat To Your Crypto)

Speaking of trust, let’s talk about another big crypto scam vector, [blind
signing](https://www.ledger.com/academy/cryptos-greatest-weakness-blind-
signing-explained).

Web3 is based on [smart
contracts](https://www.ledger.com/academy/blockchain/what-is-a-smart-
contract). When you sign a smart contract using your crypto wallet, you’re
agreeing to its specific terms.

The terms of whatever smart contract you’re interacting with will be displayed
on your crypto wallet this is how you know what you’re agreeing to. But
unfortunately, not all wallets can display these details in full – the raw
transaction data can’t be translated by the wallet into readable information.

This means users often find themselves “blind signing” – agreeing to a
transaction even when they have no way of seeing the details.

_This is a huge opportunity for scammers._

Remember those social engineering scams we spoke about? You’ll find plenty of
these that rely on blind signing. Knowing that you cannot read all the
conditions of the smart contract, but that you trust the situation, a clever
scammer will deploy a smart contract that gives them access to the contents of
your wallet. And since you can’t see this detail, and the situation seems
genuine, you agree.

## Crypto Threats Are Still Evolving

Lack of transparency along with the unfamiliar UX of crypto applications will
leave you vulnerable to attacks that you cannot detect. So, choosing a wallet
that can display transaction details, and learning how to read them, is the
only way of protecting your assets against blind signing.

Three key factors that will define your crypto security are:

  * Always use a wallet that stores your private keys separately from your internet connected device
  * Make sure you can see full transaction details every time you make a transaction. 
  * Constantly educate yourself about how crypto works, and the most recent scam tactics. 

Even though owning and interacting with cryptocurrency gives freedom, it comes
with risks that don’t exist in the fiat system. But you can be aware of these
threats and be proactive in keeping your funds secure.
