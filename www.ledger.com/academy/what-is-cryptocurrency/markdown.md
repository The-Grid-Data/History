TAKEAWAYS:  
---  
— Cryptocurrency is a type of digital currency that exists on a network called
blockchain: an infinite, immutable ledger.  
  
— Cryptocurrency allows for peer-to-peer transactions, meaning users don’t
need an intermediary or middleman.  
  
— Unlike dollars or euros, cryptocurrencies are not issued by a bank or
controlled by the government, meaning must take control of their asset’s
safekeeping.  
  
Cryptocurrencies are inherently related to the blockchain. You can’t have one
without the other. But before we get into cryptocurrencies, it’s important to
know [what a blockchain is](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-
blockchain): In simple terms, it is a digital ledger. It keeps track of value
within the network and stores transactional data. But, there’s no way for us
to access its services with cash in your pocket. Blockchains need their own
native currency to communicate with the network.

That’s where crypto comes along. Just like there are different blockchain
networks, there are different types of cryptocurrencies. In this article,
Ledger Academy will explain the ins and outs of what cryptocurrency is, how it
differs from fiat currencies, and its relationship with the blockchain.

## What Is Cryptocurrency?

Put simply, cryptocurrency is a type of currency you use on blockchains.
Similar to how we use tokens at a carnival, we need to use a different ‘type
of money’ to access blockchain services. Here is where the concept of
cryptocurrency fits in the blockchain ecosystem. These digital coins give us
access to the blockchain world, and are called “cryptocurrency.”

## Why Is It Called Cryptocurrency?

You might be wondering what could be the reason behind calling this digital
money cryptocurrency. The biggest issue with creating a digital currency is
the double spending problem. Without getting too technical, it’s hard to
create a system that ensures you can’t spend the same funds[
](http://twice.to)twice. To eliminate this issue, digital money on the
blockchain is secured by “ _Crypto_ graphy” techniques. That is why digital
money is called “ _Crypto_ currency.”

## How Does Cryptocurrency Work?

Firstly, like most currencies, cryptocurrencies are divisible. For example, 1
Bitcoin can be divided into small fractions called Satoshis – just like a
dollar splits into 100 cents. Each cryptocurrency works a little differently,
but in essence, they are quite similar.

### How Coins Come Into Existence: PoW vs PoS

Different blockchains use different [consensus
mechanisms](https://www.ledger.com/academy/consensus-protocols-how-are-
blockchains-secure) which affect how the coins come into existence. For
example, in a [proof of work](https://www.ledger.com/academy/blockchain/what-
is-proof-of-work) consensus, new coins are mined. This takes a lot of
computational power which ensures that the means it’s pointless to try and
cheat the system. This means the supply doesn’t increase too fast, which might
devalue the coin. In a [proof of
stake](https://www.ledger.com/academy/blockchain/what-is-proof-of-stake)
consensus, the supply is usually issued at launch and then capped. This means
that there will never be more than a specific number of coins.

### Allocation: Who Receives The Coins and Can Control the System?

Apart from the miners or validators, there is usually an allocation model at
the cryptocurrency’s launch. This will tell you exactly who gets a number of
coins for doing what in the system and why. But watch out – not all
cryptocurrencies are decentralized. Some cryptocurrencies allocate the
majority of their coins to a foundation run by an unelected board of
governors.

## What Is Cryptocurrency For?

Cryptocurrency is the lifeblood of the entire blockchain ecosystem. It allows
you to interact with the platforms and services of a blockchain network.
Cryptocurrencies are not managed, governed, or controlled by any central
authorities or institutions. Instead, they can power decentralized systems
that operate autonomously.

Put together, all these features make blockchain very hard or almost
impossible to alter or hack. That is what makes blockchain technology so
powerful. Besides, it provides us with major revolutionary advantages for[
countless applications](https://youtu.be/rRlmp90p-As) with the same core
principle: fostering the decentralization of traditional systems to give power
back to the people. And this is exactly what cryptocurrencies aim to do with
the traditional financial system.

You might not be able to hold cryptocurrency in your hand or keep it in your
pocket. But its value is as real as the notes in your wallet. In fact, you can
have more control over your cryptocurrencies than you can with fiat
currencies.

### Trading

You can also use cryptocurrency much like a stock for trading. In fact, there
are even cryptocurrencies that represent stocks. While that’s a topic for
another article, trading crypto is one of the top activities users opt for.
Whether you’re a day trader, or you only want to attempt it casually, make
sure you read the Ledger Academy guide on [how to trade
crypto](https://www.ledger.com/academy/how-to-trade-crypto) before you begin.

### Paying For Services or Goods

Much like you can with fiat currencies, you can use cryptocurrencies as
payment for goods and services. You can pay for anything with crypto, in the
physical or digital world. There’s a famous example of Jeremy Strudivant, the
man who paid 10,000 Bitcoin for 2 pizzas in 2010. While that may not have been
the best choice for Jeremy at the time, there are now plenty of goods and
services to spend your crypto on. From buying NFTs to donating to good causes,
there are countless things you can buy with crypto today.

### Participating in Web3 Communities Like DAOs

The blockchain is not just for moving around money. Using cryptocurrencies,
you can also take part in community governance. Decentralized autonomous
organizations ([DAOs](https://www.ledger.com/academy/blockchain/what-is-a-
dao)) use cryptocurrencies or tokens on a specific blockchain, to allow users
to vote in a decentralized manner.

### For Investing

Since blockchains provide entire economies for users, there are several ways
in which users can invest their cryptocurrencies in the hope of seeing some
returns. For example, blockchains that use a proof of stake consensus allow
users to stake a certain amount of cryptocurrency to help secure the network.
In return, the user, named a validator, receives cryptocurrency rewards. This
is just one example of a way you can invest in cryptocurrencies in a
blockchain ecosystem.,

## Cryptocurrencies vs Fiat Currencies: What’s The Difference?

All of those use cases might seem familiar to you. So you may be wondering;
what is the difference between cryptocurrency and the money in your bank
account? Well, cryptocurrencies have a few major differences from the fiat
currencies you already know.

### Crypto allows for Decentralized Ecosystems

Fiat currencies are issued by governments that control their supply and
circulation. Crypto, on the other hand, is not issued by the government. In
fact, many blockchains are governed by holders of the coins themselves. Some
blockchains have an unlimited supply of coins, while others have a capped
supply. But no single entity can print more coins without reason like
governments can with fiat currencies.

### Crypto Is Purely Digital

While your [fiat currencies](https://www.ledger.com/academy/glossary/fiat)
exist in physical form, as bills or coins, crypto is purely digital. Your
cryptocurrencies exist on the blockchain on an unhackable distributed Ledger,
meaning you can’t actually hold a Bitcoin in your hand.

### Crypto Is Permissionless

Fiat money varies from place to place. While you may have to change your
Dollars to Euros at the European border, you don’t have to do that with
crypto. Crypto can cross borders without friction.  Furthermore, you don’t
have to provide the blockchain with any personal data to own or use
cryptocurrencies. That means every nation can use them, no matter the
geoblocking issues or sanctions citizens of certain countries may have to deal
with.

### Using Cryptocurrencies Removes the Need for Middlemen

Using fiat currencies relies on middlemen, such as banks or payment services.
These are using real people or a central entity’s computer to verify
transactions. Trusting centralized entities with your funds can be risky. For
example, what if the bank goes bankrupt? Or worse, what if the person who is
meant to validate your request for a loan just doesn’t like the look of you?
Using cryptocurrencies allows for peer-to-peer transactions, meaning users on
the network can transact with each other and the system provides security.

### Crypto Transactions Are Forever

To explain, crypto transactions are irreversible. Once you make a transaction,
the blockchain records it immutably and forever. There is no going back. That
means if you accidentally send funds to the wrong address, there’s no customer
support to help you. That’s why good crypto security practices are so
important.

## Crypto and Blockchain – What’s the Difference?

While cryptocurrency is like digital money, blockchain is the network on which
the money transactions operate. Blockchain technology is a generic technical
concept – like “the Internet” and there are several different blockchains all
built on this technology. Then, each of them supports a different
cryptocurrency.

## What Is The Future of Cryptocurrency?

Crypto is the fuel for an entirely new system in which you, as a free
individual, have more power. In which you can “be your own bank”, being the
only one in control of your digital assets and the only one in charge of
keeping them secure. No central authority is involved, which empowers users.

It means more freedom and independence to make your own moves. More equality,
transparency, and privacy regarding all your actions. While cryptocurrencies
still have a long way to go and challenges to overcome, this is what crypto is
about: putting people back in the center and giving them control over their
lives.
