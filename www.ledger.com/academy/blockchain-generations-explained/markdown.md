TAKEAWAYS:  
---  
— Blockchain has been evolving, with new developments seeking to address
existing limitations or add functionalities.  
  
— The Bitcoin blockchain revolutionized the monetary system, by enabling peer-
to-peer transfers of value, negating the need for financial institutions in
this process.  
  
— The arrival of smart contracts enabled transfers of value with pre-defined
conditions. This gave rise to the DeFi, dApp, and NFT ecosystems you see
today.  
  
— The blockchain ecosystem is currently facing questions of scalability,
interoperability, and governance, all of which are driving innovation
currently.  
  
Ledger Academy dedicated the last article to explaining the origin of
blockchain and why it’s so important.

In this article, you’ll look back at the key moments in blockchain’s
development thus far, seeing what each one has brought to space – and where
things might be headed next.

## Bitcoin: Bringing Crypto to the Public

Let’s start accurately: [Bitcoin](https://www.ledger.com/academy/bitcoin-
beginners-guide) was not the first cryptocurrency or even the first
blockchain.

Blockchain technology had actually been discussed as early as 1983 by American
cryptographer [D](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/were-there-
cryptocurrencies-bitcoin/)avid Chaum – he later developed the world’s first
cryptographically managed electronic money, called ECash. However, with the
company behind ECash going bankrupt soon after, the currency itself ultimately
folded. Nonetheless, the cryptography behind ECash spurred future innovations
and ultimately played a role in the development of the Bitcoin blockchain.

Bitcoin was created to provide a radical alternative to the monetary system:
sending, receiving and “storing” value was the Bitcoin blockchain’s main
accomplishment.

As Bitcoin empowered people with the technology and allowed them to make peer-
to-peer transactions, powerful banks lost their dominance and power over
users.

This is where Bitcoin and blockchain go hand-in-hand. With Bitcoin, Bob can
send Alice digital money, and the transaction is secure despite not having an
intermediary. Both of them can maintain their privacy because the transaction
is anonymous.

## Smart Contracts: Ethereum Adds Conditions to Crypto

Bitcoin was (is) a revolutionary concept: its design allows you to send and
receive value autonomously, upending a financial system that has dominated for
centuries. But what if you want _terms and conditions_ in your transactions?
Kind of like “ _I’ll only pay Bob his cryptocurrency when he delivers my
milk”._

This is where [smart
contracts](https://www.ledger.com/academy/blockchain/what-is-a-smart-contract)
entered the blockchain world, bringing with them a wave of new options.

### Ethereum

The[ Ethereum](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-ethereum) blockchain was
launched in 2015 and ushered in a new era for crypto. Despite being launched
seven years after Bitcoin, Ethereum quickly became the second-largest
blockchain in terms of market capitalization. It shows how much the world
needed what Ethereum was offering.

The Ethereum blockchain went far beyond simple transfers of value. It was
designed as an application layer, on top of which, developers can build their
own decentralized applications and platforms with specific use cases.

### Value Transfers With Conditions

A [smart contract](https://www.ledger.com/academy/blockchain/what-is-a-smart-
contract) is a self-executing agreement made between two parties, containing
conditions in the form of “if….then”. For example, “ _If_ Alice lends Bob 10
ETH, _then_ he will pay her back monthly with 10% interest”. Now the
transactions take place only if the given conditions are met.

The two parties involved in a smart contract draw up the conditions they both
agree on. And once they are met, the contract triggers automatically. This
gave rise to a whole new generation of tokens and platforms, including
[DeFi](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-defi),
[dApps](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-a-dapp), NFTs, and stablecoins.
Let’s come back to these concepts in the coming articles.

For now, the key takeaway is this: beyond simply transacting, Ethereum enables
users to have ongoing, nuanced relationships with one another. It does this by
integrating ‘conditions’ within user interactions.

## Blockchain: Current State of the Art

Today, the blockchain ecosystem is expanding with the rising number of users
across the globe. The next big focus will be how to facilitate that for these
waves of new users. People need a reliable way to access all the available
services, no matter which specific blockchain or crypto they are using. In
other words, you need “scalability” and “interoperability” within the system.

### Mass Adoption Demands Scalability

As more and more people use blockchain solutions, networks have to accommodate
increasing traffic and be able to scale accordingly. Remaining efficient and
affordable is a challenge faced by all blockchains as the ecosystem (and
adoption) expands.

On the Ethereum network, for example, significant gas fees and slow
transaction times are both obstacles to widescale adoption. Meanwhile, other
blockchains face similar challenges, as they attempt to balance scalability
with the other key pillars of security and decentralization.

To this end, a number of the more recent blockchains are exploring the “Proof-
of-Stake” (PoS) consensus mechanism.

[Proof-of-Stake](https://www.ledger.com/academy/blockchain/what-is-proof-of-
stake#:~:text=%E2%80%94%20Proof%20of%20stake%20is%20a,traditional%20Proof%2Dof%2DWork.)
does not select miners via a process that consumes energy (like proof-of-work
does). Instead, the participants (validators) in the PoS system stake a
security deposit of crypto before participating in consensus. The network
allocates the validation of each new block based on each validator’s stake in
the system. Let’s come back to that in more detail in[ a later
article.](https://www.ledger.com/academy/blockchain/web-3-the-three-
blockchain-generations)

For now what you need to know is this: if blockchain is to be adopted en
masse, the ability to scale is essential, and this is driving a raft of
innovation in the space. But since much of it (proof-of-stake being a prime
example) is still to be properly explored and tested for its limits, the
security of these new systems in the face of changing threats will only become
apparent over time.

### Interoperability is Essential to Your Freedom

As the blockchain space expands, another issue is rising – interoperability.
In other words, whether different blockchains can communicate with each other
or not. But, why is this important?

As the blockchain and crypto ecosystem grows, it is giving birth to a wide
range of new concepts such as DeFi, dApps,
[GameFi](https://www.ledger.com/academy/nfts/what-is-play-to-earn), and the
[Metaverse](https://www.ledger.com/academy/your-metaverse-glossary). There are
hundreds of different platforms and applications, operating across a variety
of blockchains. Each blockchain has its own rules, protocols, and native
digital assets, which are not necessarily compatible with one another.

What if you, the user, own an
[avatar](https://www.ledger.com/academy/nfts/whats-with-all-the-hype-about-
crypto-avatars) on one metaverse, and want to use it on another platform built
on a different blockchain network?

If you can’t bring your value from one system into another because the two are
incompatible, you’ll find yourself locked into one ecosystem. So,
[interoperability](https://www.ledger.com/academy/cosmos-the-future-of-
blockchain-interoperability) isn’t just a casual technical term to be skimmed
over. It is about finding a way for different blockchains to communicate with
each other that directly relates to your digital sovereignty.

### Decentralized Governance is Required

Finally, the way blockchains themselves are governed is a key consideration as
crypto moves forward. Currently, many blockchains (such as Bitcoin and
Ethereum) are governed “off-chain.” In other words, a select few decide how
the network will be managed, and then implement those changes to the
blockchain via laborious processes.

But, some recent blockchain models employ a different management style. They
use tokens that are programmed with voting rights. This way, all the token
holders actively participate in the management and future of the network.
Ethereum, [Cardano](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-cardano), and
[Polkadot](https://www.ledger.com/academy/crypto/polkadot-for-dummies) are
good examples of this governance model in action. In all these networks, the
native token is programmed with voting rights, distributing the power over the
network to all the users.

This way, blockchain is not only a decentralizing force when it comes to how
you transact. With the help of this new governance model, blockchain can
become a completely decentralized organism in its operation. This is something
most networks are striving to achieve.

## Change Never Stops

Overall, blockchain is facing a raft of new challenges as it looks to the
future. If blockchain has taught us anything, it’s that absolutely everything
can be and will be improved over time. In fact, you’re already seeing a
multitude of innovations in the space. Most of them aim to expand the utility
of crypto assets so that you can use them across different ecosystems.

Now you’ve got a clear idea of the key blockchain developments, and their
contribution to the overall space. You are no more a novice and it only took a
few minutes.

Let’s move now to the topic you’ve probably been waiting for – Cryptocurrency,
its types, use cases, and how to own it.
