![Etherscan \(and other blockchain browsers\) show you smart contract data –
giving you vital information about any project](https://www.ledger.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/09/11_Classroom_Cover_Purple-1024x432.jpg) KEY TAKEAWAYS:  
---  
— The open nature of Web3 means you can access key information about crypto
projects that interest you.  
  
— Etherscan (and other blockchain browsers) show you smart contract data –
giving you vital information about any project.  
  
— Discord gives great insight into a project’s community, its traction and the
authenticity of its developers.  
  
— White papers let you see under the bonnet of a project, giving you the tech
details and roadmap.  
  
Not everyone in Web3 is friendly. But it’s not all bad – you also have endless
resources at your fingertips for doing your own research.

### What Crypto Projects Are There?

Most crypto projects will have their own White Paper, Discord Channel and of
course, a detailed account of their underlying [smart
contract](https://www.ledger.com/academy/blockchain/what-is-a-smart-contract),
which you can see by using a blockchain explorer such as Etherscan.

Web3’s openness empowers you to look beyond the hype and verify a few things
for yourself. In this article, we explain the key resources you have at your
fingertips for doing just that.

## How to Use Etherscan: Analyse Smart Contracts

Let’s start with blockchain fundamentals. Every crypto project, token or
platform has a smart contract at its base. Since smart contracts are
blockchain-based instruments, all of their key data is recorded and available
for you to inspect.

You might be wondering how exactly you can access this data – this is where
blockchain explorers like Etherscan come in. Blockchain explorers are sort of
like search engines built specifically for blockchain; they can parse through
the huge amount of on-chain data for a specific blockchain, and show you
results for different queries about the project you’re researching.

### What Can You Learn?

You can build a pretty clear picture of a project by looking at a few key
metrics on a blockchain explorer like Etherscan. These include:

  * **Contract creation date** : this allows you to see when the project’s underlying smart contract was created, so you’ll have an idea of how long the project has been running. This could be useful in helping you to spot a rug pull, since you’d expect this type of project to have a short duration.

  * **Total token supply** : looking at the total token supply for a project gives you the big picture, and indicates how much of a share in the project each individual token will buy. Buying a thousand tokens might seem like a lot, but if the total supply is 50 million, you’ll soon get some perspective on your influence within the project.

  * **Token distribution:** similarly, looking at _how those tokens are distributed_ will also give you important insights. A token supply of 50 million might seem standard – but if you notice that 10 million of them are all in the same wallet, it might indicate a volatile project, or even a rug pull, since just one individual has so much influence.

  * **Wallet transaction history:** looking at a project’s smart contract data will also show you the history of all the transactions ever made on that project, and which wallet IDs were interacting with it. If lots of transactions were really just tokens circulating through the same few wallets, it might indicate wash trading to boost the price and profile of the project, for example. Similarly, if you’re checking out a token you’re thinking of buying from a big collection, and its smart contract transaction history indicates just a few recent contract interactions, chances are it’s a fake smart contract. In either case, a look on Etherscan will give you insight on what’s going on behind the curtain of the project you’re eyeing up.

### Where to Find the Smart Contract in Crypto Projects

Before you can parse any of this data, you’ll need to find the smart contract
ID for the project you’re dealing with. It will appear either on the project’s
official website, the project’s OpenSea page, its white paper or even its
GitHub page. It may also appear on the relevant CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko
page.

Once you’ve copied this ID, you can go to a blockchain explorer (compatible
with the project’s underlying blockchain) and enter your copied smart contract
address. You’ll be able to access all of the above metrics, and many more, to
help you build a picture of your prospect.

## How to use Discord for Crypto Projects and Research

[Discord](https://www.ledger.com/academy/how-to-stay-safe-on-discord) started
life as a social hub for gamers and developers, but has risen to become one of
the central communication platforms in Web3. More or less every crypto project
has its own Discord server, acting as a hub for its community to ask
questions, collaborate and share alpha.

### What Can You Learn?

But on a more basic note, Discord is a hive of information, where you can get
a feel for a project’s community – and even do some digging on its founders.

  * Assess the team’s project

For example, if you have some questions about the project’s outlook or
technology, this is a great place to ask. A responsive team, willing to answer
your questions and concerns, is what you’d expect from a genuine project with
diligent founders. On the other hand, questions that go unanswered, or a
central team that is totally unresponsive might suggest a project with no
vision, or worse still, a scam.

  * Gauge the community’s sentiment

Skimming through the community’s comments can also reveal a lot about a
project. If the majority of comments seem to be shilling the project, or
urging you to buy in quickly, you might find the project isn’t quite what it
seems. Discord is about genuine community, not shilling.

Similarly, you can gauge how the community feels about the project – whether
they are engaged, disappointed or have key alpha to share about upcoming drops
for example.

In any case, looking at the activity on Discord is another great way to gather
information about your prospective project, and should absolutely be a part of
your research.

## Read the Project White Paper

The third key resource for doing your own research is the[ white
paper](https://www.ledger.com/academy/how-to-read-a-white-paper). In Web3, the
majority of projects have their own white paper, and the point of this
document is to provide a look under the bonnet at the project’s underlying
technology, its specific use case (if any), the road map for the future and
founding team. All of these will help you assess whether the project has a
bright, realistic future.

### Is There a Use Case?

One of the first things you should look for is the project’s use case – does
it have an application within an existing business or industry? Who are the
competitors – and does the project even need to be blockchain-based? If the
answer to these is unclear, you may want to consider whether the utility of
the project will endure past the hype.

### Who Are the Founders?

Often, white papers will name their founding team, and this can be valuable
information. If a founding team already has a successful legacy in DeFi or the
NFT space, the project might seem more appealing. On the other hand, if the
founders aren’t named or don’t have an obvious track record when it comes to
crypto projects and their underlying use-case, you might want to consider
digging a bit deeper before you make up your mind.

### Is There a Realistic Road Map?

And finally, every white paper should present a road map indicating how the
founders aim to develop the project in future. This is your chance to
understand their intentions and decide whether you think the plan is realistic
before jumping in.

## Do Your Own Research on Crypto Projects!

These are just a few key resources for understanding the Web3 space and
interacting safely – but there are hundreds more, and Ledger Academy’s sole
mission is to help you master them for yourself. Crypto projects are about
staying free, and we’re here to empower you to do that as you tap this new and
exciting space.

In our next – and final – article, we will cover the last thing you need to do
before you embark on your crypto journey: how to secure your existing crypto
with a Ledger hardware device.
