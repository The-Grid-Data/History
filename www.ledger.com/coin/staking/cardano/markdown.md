##  EARN REWARDS* BY STAKING YOUR CARDANO

Staking your Cardano allows you to passively earn rewards for helping to
secure the network.  
  
Through the Yoroi wallet or AdaLite, and by pairing it with your Ledger
hardware wallet, you can easily and securely delegate the Cardano you want to
stake.  
  
You’ll get competitive rewards, and a trustworthy validator, and you keep
ownership of your coins.

![EARN REWARDS* BY STAKING YOUR CARDANO](https://ledger-wp-
website-s3-prd.ledger.com/uploads/2022/11/image.png)

##  WHY STAKING YOUR CARDANO

Cardano, a cryptocurrency with a large market capitalization, aims to advance
Ethereum's concept with a blockchain that offers flexibility, sustainability,
and scalability for executing smart contracts. This enables the creation of
various decentralized finance applications, crypto tokens, games, and other
innovations.

__Maximise your assets

Don't let your assets gather dust. Put them to work and make them grow with
Ledger.

__Secure the network

When you stake Cardano, you make the Cardano blockchain successful by securing
the network and validating transactions.

##  STAKING CARDANO IS BETTER WITH A WALLET APP THAT SUPPORT THE MOST SECURE
COLD WALLET

__

###  Secure

Pairing your Ledger with a third-party wallet, allow you to grow your Cardano
bag **securely**.

__

###  Ownership

Keep **full custody** of your assets when you stake with Yoroi wallet or
AdaLite, unlike with crypto exchanges.

__

###  Freedom of choice

It's up to you to choose which validators you want to delegate your Cardano
too.

![Earn rewards](https://www.ledger.com/wp-
content/themes/ledger-v2/public/images/staking/rewards.png)

##  Earn rewards

You can passively grow your assets by participating in the Cardano network. By
delegating your ADA to a validator, you will receive rewards for helping to
secure the network.  
  
The current annual yield on Cardano is around 3%.  
  
You can stop delegating your Cardano at any time and you will no need to wait
to unlock your ADA tokens.

## Frequently Asked Questions

__How Do Cardano Staking Work?

Cardano utilizes Proof-of-Stake as its consensus mechanism, in which users
invest a coin to have the chance to serve as a validator. There are two ways
to take part in the staking and validation process: by becoming a stake pool
owner or operator. Stake pools serve as trusted server nodes that validate
transactions.

To be a stake pool owner, one must delegate their Ada to a pool. This can be
done by creating your own private pool or by pledging your Ada to an existing
one.

A stake pool operator, on the other hand, is responsible for the maintenance
of the pool and its duties include renting servers, monitoring the node,
safeguarding the pool key, and performing other administrative tasks.

__What is the staking lockup period for Cardano?

When staking to a Cardano stake pool, you can freely transfer your ADA in and
out of your wallet, for trading or spending purposes, without any lock-in
period. Just ensure that your ADA is in a pool before the epoch snapshot
period for it to be counted for rewards.

__Do I still have control over my crypto when I delegate them to a validator?

You have **full ownership** of your Cardano when you stake through a third-
party wallet, unlike with crypto exchanges.
