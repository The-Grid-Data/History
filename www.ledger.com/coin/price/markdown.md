### Cryptocurrency prices and charts

The details contained on this page are for informational purposes only and are
of a general nature.  Nothing contained in this article constitutes tax,
legal, financial, or investment advice nor is it not intended as a
recommendation for buying, trading, or selling crypto assets. References to
any securities or digital assets are for illustrative purposes only.  Crypto
assets are volatile. You should be fully aware of the level of risk involved
before engaging in crypto-related activities.  Please educate yourself to make
informed decisions. It is recommended to seek independent advice from reliable
and qualified experts before engaging in such activities and on your tax
affairs.  Any loss of data, crypto assets, or profit is your sole
responsibility. Ledger is not responsible for the consequences of reliance
upon any opinion or statement contained herein or for any omission.

#### Where can I check the latest crypto prices?

Due to market volatility, it can be challenging to stay on top of Bitcoin,
Ethereum, and other cryptocurrency prices.

With Ledger, you can easily stay on top of the ever-changing crypto market. On
our website and the Ledger Live app, you can find the latest prices, value
movements, 24-hour trading volumes, historical performance charts, market
capitalization figures, circulating supply, and more.

#### How does Ledger calculate crypto prices?

Ledger relies on CoinGecko’s API to fetch prices, historical market data,
exchange trading volume, and trading pairs in real time. CoinGecko uses a
global volume-weighted average price formula that incorporates asset prices
across different exchanges. For further information on how CoinGecko tracks
prices and other metrics, check out its [methodology
page](https://www.coingecko.com/en/methodology).



#### Does Ledger list all cryptocurrencies on the website?

No, Ledger doesn’t list all cryptocurrencies on the website. There is a
vetting process in place to screen each coin before it’s listed.



#### Why do crypto prices differ from one exchange to another?

This is known as the price difference.

There are several reasons for price differences across exchanges:

  * **Fees** : each exchange has different fees associated with buying or selling an asset.
  * **Trade volume & liquidity**: higher trading volumes tend to bring more liquidity.
  * **Order book size** : not all exchanges offer the same range of orders.
  * **Market sentiment & manipulation**: traders who drive up prices on one exchange can push up prices on other exchanges.



#### What determines the price and value of cryptocurrencies?

Crypto prices are largely determined by the supply-demand balance between
buyers and sellers. Most cryptocurrencies are distributed and limited by max
supply. The higher the demand for a cryptocurrency, the higher its price will
be. If a cryptocurrency is in low demand, the price decreases. When supply and
demand are equal, the market is stable.

Prices can also swing quickly depending on various news or events. Finally,
fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) can drive prices down.

#### What is the best cryptocurrency to invest in?

Ledger does not provide financial or investment advice on which
cryptocurrency, token, or asset to invest in. Ledger also does not offer
recommendations about the timing of when to buy or sell crypto. Remember that
the prices, yields, and values of financial assets are subject to change.
Investing any capital carries risk.

### Cryptocurrency market cap

#### What is crypto market cap?

Crypto market capitalization (crypto market cap for short) is a metric that
measures the size and popularity of a cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrencies with
high cap rank higher and have a larger share of the market.



#### How to calculate the crypto market cap?

Crypto market cap is calculated by multiplying the total number of coins in
circulation by their current price.



#### What cryptocurrencies have the largest market cap?

The crypto market cap can be divided into three categories:

  * **Large-cap** : >$10 billion
  * **Mid-cap** : $1 billion – $10 billion
  * **Small-cap** : <$1 billion

Cryptocurrencies with a market capitalization of over $10 billion, such as
Bitcoin and Ethereum, are considered to have large caps. These protocols are
well-established and have a strong community of developers who maintain,
improve, and build new projects.

Keep in mind that the market cap of a cryptocurrency can appear artificially
high due to volatility in price or the tokenomics of its coin supply. To gain
a more accurate understanding of a cryptocurrency’s value, it is recommended
to analyze its other metrics such as trading volume, liquidity, and fully
diluted valuation.



#### What is Bitcoin dominance?

Bitcoin dominance is the percentage of Bitcoin’s market cap compared to that
of altcoins. Altcoins, which stands for “alternatives to BTC,” are all other
cryptocurrencies apart from Bitcoin. Bitcoin dominance indicates that more
capital flows into Bitcoin than any other cryptocurrency.



### What’s the difference between coins and tokens?

Coins and tokens are both forms of digital assets, but they have different
characteristics and use cases.

A coin is a type of digital currency that’s native to its blockchain. For
example, the Bitcoin blockchain native’s coin is BTC. The Ethereum blockchain
has ETH. These crypto coins are designed to achieve a specific goal: to store
value, work as a medium of exchange, pay transaction fees, etc.

Tokens are not native to a blockchain and are instead built on top of it,
often through the use of smart contracts. They can represent assets such as
shares in a DAO, digital products, NFTs, or even physical objects.

A blockchain can only have one coin, but it can have hundreds of assets called
tokens built on top of it. For example, there are many other tokens built on
top of the Ethereum blockchain like MATIC, LINK, and USDT.



### The different types of coins and tokens

Today, there are several types of coins and tokens, including utility tokens,
exchange tokens, payment tokens, security tokens, stablecoins, DeFi tokens,
NFTs, and asset-backed tokens.



#### What are utility tokens?

Utility tokens have value only within their respective ecosystems. While they
may have a monetary value on the open crypto market, they are not intended to
be a medium of exchange, a hedge against inflation, or a long-term store of
value. Utility tokens have a specific purpose within an ecosystem and can be
used to drive growth or to raise funds.

Examples of utility tokens include LINK (Chainlink), UNI (Uniswap), and the
Basic Attention Token (BAT).



#### What are non-fungible tokens (NFTs)?

An NFT is a digital asset that represents ownership of something unique and
scarce, such as tokenized physical assets or rare digital resources. Each NFT
is unique and it can’t be replaced with another identical token. The majority
of NFTs are based on the ERC721 standard.

Examples of NFTs: CryptoPunks, Bored Ape, Jack Dorsey’s first tweet, Beeple’s
Crossroad, or Everydays: the First 5000 Days.



#### What is a stablecoin?

A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency with a value pegged to another
asset’s price. For example, a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar should
always be valued at $1.

There are different types of stablecoins :

  * **Fiat-collateralized stablecoins**. Backed by fiat currencies such as the Euro, GBP, or US dollar. They are backed 1:1—for every stablecoin, there is an equal amount of currency held in a bank account reserve. Users can exchange their stablecoins for the corresponding amount of fiat currency, which is then transferred to their bank account. In parallel, the equivalent amount of stablecoins is taken out of circulation or destroyed.  
Examples of fiat-collateralized stablecoins: Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC),
Gemini Dollar (GUSD), True USD (TUSD), and Paxos Standard (PAX).

  * **Algorithmic stablecoins**. Rely on algorithms and smart contracts to maintain price stability, rather than using fiat or cryptocurrency as collateral.  
Examples of algorithmic stablecoins: Multi-Collateral Dai (DAI), Frax (FRAX),
Magic Internet Money (MIM), and USDD (USDD).

  * **Collateralized stablecoins**. Backed by another cryptocurrency as collateral. This is done through smart contracts, rather than a central issuer. To obtain these stablecoins, the user locks their cryptocurrency in a smart contract and receives tokens of equal value. To withdraw the original collateral, the user needs to put the stablecoin back into the smart contract.  
Examples of collateralized stablecoins: Multi-Collateral Dai (DAI).

  * **Commodity-backed stablecoins**. Collateralized using physical assets like precious metals, oil, gold, or real estate. The owners of commodity-collateralized stablecoins have ownership over a tangible asset with real value.  
Examples of commodity-backed stablecoins: Tether Gold (XAUT) and Paxos Gold
(PAXG).
