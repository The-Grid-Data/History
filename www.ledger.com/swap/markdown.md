### Learn more about crypto!

Having crypto does not necessarily mean owning it. When you own crypto, what
counts is the key that gives access to your coins: your private key. The
person that has access to this key really owns the associated coins and can do
whatever they want with them. When buying, exchanging and storing your coins
on an exchange, the exchange actually owns your private keys, and therefore,
your assets. Not you. Much like a bank holding your money.



At Ledger we created a solution that enables you to secure and own this
private key throughout your crypto journey – and to become the only person in
charge of your coins.
