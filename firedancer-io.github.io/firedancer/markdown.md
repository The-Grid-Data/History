# Firedancer ðŸ”¥ðŸ’ƒ

Solana validator

A new Solana validator client, built from the ground up for performance

## Fast

Designed from the ground up to be fast. The concurrency model is borrowed from
the low latency trading space, and the code contains many novel high
performance reimplementations of core Solana primitives.

## Secure

The architecture of the validator allows it to run with a highly restrictive
sandbox and almost no system calls.

## Independent

Firedancer is written from scratch. This brings client diversity to the Solana
network and helps it stay resilient to supply chain attacks in build tooling
or dependencies.
