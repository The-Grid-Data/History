GOFX Token Information

GOFX is a multifunctional utility token of the GooseFX ecosystem, to engage
with various platform features. Key aspects include:

  * **Staking Incentives:** Stakers of GOFX earn a share of the platform's total fees, collected from Single-Sided Liquidity pools and the Perps DEX. These fees are converted to USDC for stable payouts, with rewards proportional to the amount of GOFX staked and claimable daily.

  * **Loyalty Tiers and Reduced Fees:** Holding and staking GOFX categorizes users into different loyalty tiers, with higher tiers offering reduced trading fees and other benefits.

  * **Buyback and Burn Program:** 10% of revenue from GooseFX's Single-Sided Liquidity Pools is used to buy back GOFX tokens from the market, which are then burned hourly. This approach aims to reduce the total supply and increase the scarcity of GOFX, steering it towards a deflationary model.

  * **Earnings and Lock-up Period:** Unstaking GOFX initiates a seven-day lock-up period, during which no rewards are earned.
