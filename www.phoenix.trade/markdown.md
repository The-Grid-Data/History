### Faster Trades

Trades are confirmed on-chain within 0.5 seconds on Phoenix. Place orders
without waiting.

### Instant settlement

With Phoenix's crankless design, funds are immediately available for
withdrawal once orders are filled.

Transparency

## A fully on-chain DEX with transparency at its core.

##### Non-custodial

Maintain total control of your assets. Your private keys remain private.

##### Trustless

Genuine peer-to-peer trades. Full autonomy and control—no middleman involved.

anytime.

Execution

## Designed for the optimal user experience

Price-time priority is enforced on Phoenix orderbooks.  
  
Orders closest to mid price get filled first. For orders of the same price,
the one placed first gets filled first.
