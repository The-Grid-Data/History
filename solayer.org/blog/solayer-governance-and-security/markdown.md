Solayer Governance and Security

Solayer Core

May 15, 2024

The Solayer contract is inherently upgradable for several reasons. Firstly,
stage 1 will be released in multiple phases, necessitating contract upgrades.
Secondly, in emergencies, the core team must be able to swiftly implement
proactive changes. Lastly, to ensure transparency and a community-first
approach, the Solayer core team has decided to decentralize the development
process. Hence, contract ownership is migrated to a multisig of known
individuals within the Solana community.

  

**Multisig Address: GcYvLKKEWpxQMqFe9HUcDJYMGvXt7kwf8gfBvjnW4wnm**

**Program: sSo1iU21jBrU9VaJ8PJib1MtorefUV4fzC9GURa2KNn**

  

The upgradability of the Solayer contract is overseen by trusted community
leaders. Initially, we have selected 3 out of the 5 multisig seat holders,
with one seat occupied by the Solayer core team. To maintain our commitment to
transparency and a community-first approach, we will gather community feedback
to appoint 1 more community member to the governing seat. Candidates will be
evaluated diligently following a public forum, and more information will be
released soon.

  

This multisig controls protocol-code upgrades. To modify our program, the
multisig must have a 3 out of 5 quorum signing to approve any upgrade. Solayer
core team may conduct a forum to discuss potential increase or decrease of
seat holders and quorum threshold.

  

Special shoutout to Squads for providing seamless Solana multisig experience!

  

**Below are the first 3 community seat holders, out of 5 in total.**

Solayer**Stage 1 contract** has gone through vigorous audit with Ottersec, and
will continue to initiate bug bounty programs internally and with external
parties.
