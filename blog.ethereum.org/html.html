Last week, Ethereum client, testing and research teams from around the world gathered together for a week of intense work on the Pectra network upgrade, PeerDAS and the Verge.

Similarly to previous events like Edelweiss 🏔️ or Amphora 🏺, the focus of the Nyota ✨ interop was achieving multi-client interoperability across the different technical tracks.

In addition to this, Nyota was preceded with a first of its kind public event: Frontiers Africa, where core devs &amp; researchers spent the day meeting &amp; exchanging with builders from across the region.

- Review the program details for EPF5 🔎
- Applications for EPF5 are open until May 26 📝
- A town hall will be held for an overview and questions on May 21 at 4PM UTC. 🎙️


We are excited to announce that the applications are now open for the  fifth cohort of the Ethereum Protocol Fellowship (EPF5).

The EPF provides a pathway for aspiring protocol contributors to make meaningful contributions to Ethereum.  In each cohort, a diverse group is assembled to work toward advancing Ethereum's technology during the fellowship. This includes everything from the development of client implementations, testing and specifications, and participating in the latest core protocol research.

The program provides fellows with a unique opportunity to collaborate with other talented individuals,</p></div></div></div></div><div class="css-yl0pq7"><div class="chakra-stack css-mwwdg9" data-group="true"><div class="css-8u19qt"><div class="css-1y5q4gd"><div class="css-0"><p class="chakra-text css-1uh66ln">April 22, 2024</p></div><a class="chakra-link css-13jvj27" href="/category/research-and-development"><div class="css-0"><p class="chakra-text css-114hemn">R&amp;D</p></div></a></div><a class="chakra-link css-spn4bz" tabindex="-1" href="/2024/04/22/epf-4-recap"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:none;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0"><img alt="Ethereum Protocol Fellowship Cohort 4 Recap" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%;object-fit:cover"><noscript><img alt="Ethereum Protocol Fellowship Cohort 4 Recap" sizes="100vw" srcSet="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstorage.googleapis.com%2Fethereum-hackmd%2Fupload_ef8a5602779302657f773c9b6715e749.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 640w, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstorage.googleapis.com%2Fethereum-hackmd%2Fupload_ef8a5602779302657f773c9b6715e749.png&amp;w=750&amp;q=75 750w, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstorage.googleapis.com%2Fethereum-hackmd%2Fupload_ef8a5602779302657f773c9b6715e749.png&amp;w=828&amp;q=75 828w, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstorage.googleapis.com%2Fethereum-hackmd%2Fupload_ef8a5602779302657f773c9b6715e749.png&amp;w=1080&amp;q=75 1080w, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstorage.googleapis.com%2Fethereum-hackmd%2Fupload_ef8a5602779302657f773c9b6715e749.png&amp;w=1200&amp;q=75 1200w, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstorage.googleapis.com%2Fethereum-hackmd%2Fupload_ef8a5602779302657f773c9b6715e749.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1920w, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstorage.googleapis.com%2Fethereum-hackmd%2Fupload_ef8a5602779302657f773c9b6715e749.png&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75 2048w, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstorage.googleapis.com%2Fethereum-hackmd%2Fupload_ef8a5602779302657f773c9b6715e749.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 3840w" src="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstorage.googleapis.com%2Fethereum-hackmd%2Fupload_ef8a5602779302657f773c9b6715e749.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%;object-fit:cover" loading="lazy"/></noscript></span></a></div><div class="chakra-stack css-1g7quxy"><div class="css-1okda57"><a class="chakra-link css-qbxetx" href="/2024/04/22/epf-4-recap">Ethereum Protocol Fellowship Cohort 4 Recap</a></div><div class="css-1y8927a"><p class="chakra-text css-1eam21a">by Protocol Support Team<!-- --></p></div><div class="css-itbrjv"><p class="chakra-text css-jxubeb">
TL;DR: The EPF concluded the fourth cohort and is preparing for a fifth cohort. Applications will be open soon. In the meantime, explore the new EPF.wiki and sign up to get notified when they open.

Ethereum is growing, and diversity of human participation creates resilience throughout the ecosystem. The Devconnect Scholars Program is one small effort that aims to create resilience through community diversity. Better representation across human geography and demographics leads to diverse experiences and new perspectives that help the Ethereum protocol serve the coordination needs of all humans, not just a lucky few. Not only does better representation - leading to better geographical distribution of Ethereum nodes for example - help the security of the network, but we believe it is crucial in enriching our community and in making Ethereum stories tangible for more people.

The Scholars Program brought to Devconnect Istanbul 22 builders from communities that are currently underrepresented in Ethereum.

The Ethereum Foundation is thrilled to announce a collaborative grant round with Aztec, Polygon, Scroll, Taiko, and zkSync to develop Zero Knowledge public goods projects. Each co-funder of the grant round has contributed 150K USD in funds, bringing the total grant pool to 900K USD.

The breadth and complexity of the Layer 2 ecosystem has reached a point where identifying shared needs and dependencies requires the participation of domain experts from a range of stakeholders.

In the context of databases and eth2, sharding means breaking up the storage and computation of the whole system into shards, processing the shards separately, and combining the results as needed. Specifically, eth2 implements many shard chains, where each shard has similar capabilities to the eth1 chain. This results in massive scaling improvements.\n\nHowever, there's a less-well-known type of sharding in eth2.

In practice, however, one major challenge still remains: how to actually interact with the world around them.\n\n","url":"/2013/12/31/bootstrapping-an-autonomous-decentralized-corporation-part-2-interacting-with-the-world"},{"frontmatter":{"title":"Bootstrapping A Decentralized Autonomous Corporation: Part I","date":"2013-12-31T18:00:37+00:00","author":"Vitalik Buterin","category":"Research \u0026 Development","image":"/images/posts/blackhole.jpg"},"content":"\nCorporations, US presidential candidate Mitt Romney reminds us, are people.

If a corporation does something, it’s because its board of directors has agreed that it should be done.
