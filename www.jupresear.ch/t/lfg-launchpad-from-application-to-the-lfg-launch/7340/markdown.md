[Mar 5](/t/lfg-launchpad-from-application-to-the-lfg-launch/7340 "Post date")

Let’s take a look at the whole LFG launchpad application to launch the
process.

Anyone can apply through our open process via the [Jupiter Research Forum
931](https://www.jupresear.ch/). The J.U.P DAO then votes on who is accepted
to the LFG Launchpad through on-chain governance using the JUP token.

## This is a 4-step process

Step 1 - Jupresear.ch forum post  
Step 2 - Candidate Introduction  
Step 3 - DAO Voting  
Step 4 - Launch!  
  

**Step 1 - The Jupresearch forum post**

Anyone can apply by posting on the Forum in the [LFG Introduction section
767](https://www.jupresear.ch/c/lfg-intros/12) and following the rough outline
provided in [the first forum post 231](https://www.jupresear.ch/t/lfg-
launchpad-introducing-your-project-to-the-community/5234/2) explaining the LFG
introduction section in this forum, and then make your case to the DAO. Every
project is free to initiate a discussion on the Jupresear.ch Forum or within
the #lfg-candidate channel in [Discord 176](https://discord.com/invite/jup).  
  
  
**Step 2 - The candidate stage**

Certain candidates are then elevated to the candidacy stage based on criteria
such as community sentiment, Catdet feedback, traction, TGE timing, and
quality of introduction.

When a project reaches the candidacy stage, it’ll get a dedicated Discord
forum thread where the project can engage in a more intimate discussion with
the DAO. They’ll also automatically qualify for the next LFG Launchpad vote,
contingent on partaking in an AMA with the working group.  
  
  
**Step 3 - The DAO vote**

During the first week of each month, the DAO votes on which 2 candidate
projects get to launch in the coming month.

For example, the first week of January would hold the vote for candidates to
launch in February.

The vote will be held on vote.jup.ag and will run for 3 days (72 hours). After
the 3 days, up to 2 projects will be allowed to launch next month.

Note: The LFG approval vote can only be initiated if there are 2 or more
viable candidates for the voting period.  
  
  
**Step 4 - LFG, launch!** ![:rocket:](https://emoji.discourse-
cdn.com/twitter/rocket.png?v=12)

Once the vote has concluded, the working groups will coordinate with the
approved projects alongside the Jupiter team to set their launch dates.  
  

**Built by the community and for the community, empowered by the DAO**

It is important to note that this initial process will not resemble what the
process ultimately becomes. Sourcing feedback from the community will enable
changes over time to achieve a more refined launch process. After the initial
projects are voted upon and launched, there will be a period for feedback
sessions where the community will be able to voice any concerns or suggestions
to the working group.

Over and out!

Love it! The staking and voting processes were both such a smooth, seamless
experience. Can’t wait for all that’s in store for JUP and the community! LFG!
