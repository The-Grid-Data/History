Solana Permissioned Environments

# The power of Solana — customized for your business.

Solana is an open source global state machine that is built for enterprise
scale. Solana Permissioned Environments, or SPEs, bring a private Solana
Virtual Machine to businesses with custom requirements — creating a dedicated
environment that uses the Solana protocol’s unparalleled tech.

## Permissioned chains for large-scale enterprises.

## Control your environment

Build a Solana environment for your custom requirements — whether needing to
geofence nodes, maintain ultimate authority in a network, or keep an instance
private for security and compliance.

## Tooling for enterprises

The Solana ecosystem is home to a number of native tools that are available
out-of-the-box. Save costs by using state compression, solidity language
support through Solang, or programmatic bridging across chains.

## Built for scale

SPEs can have all the advantages of the Solana protocol’s best-in-industry
tech — high throughput, parallelization, fast settlement time, affordable
fees, and low environmental impact.

## More features with token extensions

Token extensions, the new token standard for the Solana protocol, enable Get
native support for enterprise features — without third party tooling. Enable
permanent delegation, native metadata, stablecoin tooling, and more.
