# Validated

When it comes to blockchain, the thing people talk about most — the price — is
actually the least interesting part. Crypto conversations are too often about
who’s up and who’s down, what to buy and what to sell, and today’s drama on
Twitter. Most conversations about crypto miss how it’s going to change ...
everything. On VALIDATED, we’ll be talking to the people who are rethinking
the internet — and our world. No hype cycles. No financial advice. Just
conversations on the biggest ideas shaping the future of the internet. Web3 is
complicated, but never boring.
