# [Solana Documentation](/docs)

Solana is a blockchain built for mass adoption. It's a high performance
network that is utilized for a range of use cases, including finance, NFTs,
payments, and gaming. Solana operates as a single global state machine, and is
open, interoperable and decentralized.

## Getting started #

Dive right into Solana to start building or setup your tooling.

  * [Setup local environment](/developers/guides/getstarted/setup-local-development) \- Install the Solana CLI to get your local development environment setup
  * [Hello World in your browser](/developers/guides/getstarted/hello-world-in-your-browser) \- Build and deploy your first on-chain Solana program, directly in your browser using Solana Playground

## Start learning #

Build a strong understanding of the core concepts that make Solana different
from other blockchains.

  * [Transactions](/docs/core/transactions) \- Collection of instructions for the blockchain to execute
  * [Accounts](/docs/core/accounts) \- Data and state storage mechanism for Solana
  * [Programs](/docs/core/programs) \- The executable code used to perform actions on the blockchain
  * [Cross-Program Invocation](/docs/core/cpi) \- Core of the "composability" of Solana, this is how programs can "call" each other.

## Understanding the architecture #

Get to know the underlying architecture of how the proof-of-stake blockchain
works.

  * [Validators](https://docs.solanalabs.com/validator/anatomy) \- the individual nodes that are the backbone of the network
  * [Clusters](/docs/core/clusters) \- a collection of validators that work together for consensus

## Running a validator #

Explore what it takes to operate a Solana validator and help secure the
network.

  * [System requirements](https://docs.solanalabs.com/operations/requirements) \- Recommended hardware requirements and expected SOL needed to operate a validator
  * [Quick start guide](https://docs.solanalabs.com/operations/setup-a-validator) \- Setup a validator and get connected to a cluster for the first time
