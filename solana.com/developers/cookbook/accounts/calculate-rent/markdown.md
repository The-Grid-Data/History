# [How to Calculate Account Creation
Cost](/developers/cookbook/accounts/calculate-rent)

Keeping accounts alive on Solana incurs a storage cost called rent. For the
calculation, you need to consider the amount of data you intend to store in
the account. Rent can be reclaimed in full if the account is closed.

calculate-rent.ts

    
    
    import { Connection, clusterApiUrl } from "@solana/web3.js";
     
    (async () => {
      const connection = new Connection(clusterApiUrl("devnet"), "confirmed");
     
      // length of data in bytes in the account to calculate rent for
      const dataLength = 1500;
      const rentExemptionAmount =
        await connection.getMinimumBalanceForRentExemption(dataLength);
      console.log({
        rentExemptionAmount,
      });
    })();
