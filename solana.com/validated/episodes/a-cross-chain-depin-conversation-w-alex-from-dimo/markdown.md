## Episode Summary

In this episode, Austin chats with Alex Rawitz, co-founder of DIMO, a DePIN
project built on Polygon which allows users to collect and monetize their
car's data. Instead of pitting one blockchain against another, Austin and Alex
have an optimistic, open-minded discussion about the DePIN space in general.
The conversation also highlights a non-maxi, cross-chain attitude toward
building DePIN projects; though built on Polygon, DIMO leverages the Helium
network (which migrated to Solana last year) for its IoT piece.
