## Mint by the millions

With state compression for NFTs, the cost of high-volume drops just got a lot
cheaper. Imagine onboarding new users en masse or rewarding existing users for
just a few hundred dollars, instead of a few hundred thousand. From event
ticketing, to collectibles, to social media stickers and more, compressed NFTs
open up a whole new world of possibilities.  
  
This is made possible by [state compression](/news/state-compression-
compressed-nfts-solana), a technique in which transaction data secured by the
Solana ledger is hashed and verified against a Merkle tree account for use in
a smart contract. This means that compressed NFTs can be created onchain in a
similar manner as before, but for a fraction of the cost.

## Tech that scales, ultra fast

With Solana’s native scalability, you don’t need to make a tradeoff between
decentralization and performance. Whether you’re building the [next big thing
in gaming](/developers/gaming), or focused on frontiers like AI or
decentralized physical infrastructure (dePIN), let your imagination run wild
and build the kind of application that’s only possible on Solana.  
  
Ground-breaking projects like [Helium](/news/helium-upgrades-to-solana) and
[Hivemapper](/news/case-study-hivemapper) are building what’s only possible on
Solana, thanks to its transaction speeds, scalability and reliability. And
with integrations in [areas such as AI](/developers/ai), builders on Solana
have access to the latest innovations to fuel their most ambitious projects.

## Climate-conscious tech

On Solana, a blockchain transaction uses about the [same amount of energy as a
few online searches](/environment). And with [real-time emissions
measurement](/news/announcing-real-time-emissions-measurement-on-the-solana-
blockchain), you can be sure you’re building on tech that not only performs,
but is committed to energy efficiency.  
  
The emissions tracker software embedded directly on Solana nodes provides
comprehensive and dynamic measurements over time. This data set is detail-
rich, open, and free to use, making it possible for validators or anyone
building on Solana to evaluate their contributions to the network’s carbon
footprint and explore mitigation strategies.
