# [How to Generate Mnemonics for
Keypairs](/de/developers/cookbook/wallets/generate-mnemonic)

One way to generate a Keypair is through the use of a Mnemonic. Mnemonics are
generally used to make the user experience within wallets better than a
Keypair file by using a list of readable words (instead of a shorter string of
random numbers and letters).

    import * as bip39 from "bip39";
     
    const mnemonic = bip39.generateMnemonic();
