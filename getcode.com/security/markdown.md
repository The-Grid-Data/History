Security Policy

Last Update: March 2023

Code is built for security

Code is intentionally lightweight with most of its infrastructure running on-
chain with audited programs.

Code never has access to your funds

Code is a self custodial crypto wallet, which means only you control your
assets. Your private key is encrypted and stored on your device. It is never
stored by Code or shared with others.

Code doesn't collect any personal information outside of your phone number

Your phone number is used for account verification. It is the only piece of
personal information collected.

Code doesn't do any tracking

Code doesn't track any of your activity. You can learn more about Code's
Privacy Policy at: [getcode.com/privacy](http://getcode.com/privacy)

Code has been audited

All on chain programs used by the Code wallet have been audited by Ottersec,
one of the leading web3 security firms.
