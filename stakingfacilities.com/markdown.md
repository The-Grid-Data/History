# FAQs

#### What is a Blockchain?

keyboard_arrow_down

A blockchain is an immutable, distributed ledger of transactions which is
maintained by a peer-to-peer network rather than a centralized authority. It
can be thought of as a distributed database that gets synchronized as soon as
changes are made.

Blockchain technology utilizes powerful consensus mechanisms (such as Proof-
of-Stake) alongside crypto-economic incentives to verify the authenticity of
transactions, secure the peer-to-peer network, and nominate nodes (special
peers in the network) to generate blocks.

#### What is Proof-of-Stake?

keyboard_arrow_down

Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is a consensus algorithm used for the generation of new
blocks. It requires validators (special nodes running the blockchain) to stake
the network's native token in order to propose and/or validate new blocks and
ultimately earn rewards. A stake may be slashed by the network and thus
disincentives bad behavior.

#### What is a Validator?

keyboard_arrow_down

Validators are special nodes in PoS-networks, more precisely delegated Proof-
of-Stake networks. They operate the blockchain infrastructure, propose and
validate new blocks, and receive rewards (in the form of new tokens) for doing
so.

#### What is a Delegator?

keyboard_arrow_down

Token holders who want to stake their tokens but do not want to run a
validator node, are called delegators. They can still contribute to the
networks' security and earn rewards by delegating their tokens to a validator
of their choice and thus use the validatorâs infrastructure instead of
setting-up and maintaining their own servers. For some networks, in the event
of a validator misbehaving according to the protocol, delegators of the
respective validator will also be penalized by the blockchain network in
proportion to their staked assets. We therefore advise you to carefully choose
your validator infrastructure.

#### What is a Node Operator?

keyboard_arrow_down

Similar to validators, nope operators are special participants within
blockchain networks. For the different networks across the Web 3.0 tech stack,
that we work with, we differentiate our role between validator and node
operator. The former allows us to accept delegations by token-holders, whereas
we do not accept delegations in the network in which we function as a node
operator. In these networks, we provide services to the network such as data
indexing or providing off-chain data as an oracle.

#### What is Web 3.0?

keyboard_arrow_down

Web 3.0 is also referred to as the "Internet of Value" or the "Stateful Web"
and is considered as the next evolution of the internet after Web 2.0 and Web
1.0. Web 3.0 is the result of technologies such as AI, IoT, or blockchain
converging. Blockchains play an important part as they allow for an
alternative to the client-server model in which data is centrally controlled
and managed by trusted institutions. This has oftentimes led to privacy
issues, monopolistic tendencies, hacks, and data breaches. In the current
internet, it is not possible to transact value in a digital native manner.
Cryptography and game theory, used in blockchain networks, allow for an
alternative to the current architecture of the internet. One that is powered
and secured through decentralized infrastructure. Blockchain technology
provides a "clearinghouse" and settlement layer to the internet, overcomes
single points of failure, allows for digitally-native assets, as well as
collaboration and coordination on a global scale. We are pioneering this new
digital frontier. Join us on this exciting journey!

â

#### What is non-custodial staking?

keyboard_arrow_down

Non-custodial staking refers to the process of using a validatorâs
infrastructure by delegating the capability to work for the blockchain and
provide infrastructure to the blockchain and ultimately earn rewards by the
blockchain network for doing so to someone else. This applies to every Proof-
of-Stake token. Delegating tokens is not the same as sending tokens, because
delegators do not transfer ownership in the token itself. The original holder
remains the legal owner of the tokens at all times. Hence, the holder does not
give up custody of his/her token.

#### Why should I stake my tokens?

keyboard_arrow_down

Proof-of-Stake blockchains are inflationary as new tokens are rewarded for
generating and validating new blocks. Token holders who are not engaging in
the staking process - either by operating as a validator themselves or by
delegating their tokens to validators and thus using the validatorâs
infrastructure - stand to lose out on rewards and see their assets getting
diluted over time.

#### What are the risks associated with delegating my assets to Staking
Facilities?

keyboard_arrow_down

Since we offer non-custodial delegation services for our networks, we never
have control over your assets. Rest assured, you are always in full control of
your assets and can withdraw the delegation at any time. By delegating to us,
your assets are virtually added to our stake. The blockchain network
automatically transfers rewards to your blockchain address and we keep a small
fee as a consideration for operating the infrastructure you use. We offer a
transparent service and operate industry-grade architecture in order to
achieve our goal to always meet the protocolâs service levels (e.g. no
double signing; going offline etc.) and to avoid slashing. Please visit the
subpage of the respective protocol for more details. For general information
about risks refer to our[ terms](https://assets-global.website-
files.com/5f699e8d6a7c1154451f214a/5fc6467f2e972125b68d821e_SF_Terms-and-
Conditions_11_2020.pdf) which you accept by delegating tokens to our
validator.

Further risks include: key/asset mismanagement by the enduser resulting in
loss of funds; protocol errors; or attacks against the network.

#### Does Staking Facilities have access to my tokens?

Our validation services are non-custodial. We therefore have no access to your
tokens at any point in time. It is simply impossible from a technical
perspective. You maintain full control over your tokens at all times.
