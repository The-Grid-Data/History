# Terms Of Service

_**Last Revised on April 26, 2023**_

Welcome to the Terms of Service (these “**Terms** ”) for the website
<https://staratlas.com> (the “**Website** ”), the Star Atlas game (the
“**Game** ”), and all content and functionalities accessible via our Website
and the Game (including the Star Atlas Wallet, as defined below) other than
the Star Atlas DAO (as defined below) (collectively, the “**Services** ”), in
each case operated by or on behalf of ATMTA, Inc. (“**Company** ,” “**we** ,”
or “**us** ”), a Delaware corporation. For clarity, the Services do not
include the operations of the Star Atlas DAO or any websites relating thereto.

These Terms govern your access to and use of the Services. Please read these
Terms carefully, as they include important information about your legal
rights. By accessing and/or using the Services, you are agreeing to these
Terms. If you do not understand or agree to these Terms, please do not use the
Services.

For purposes of these Terms, “**you** ” and “**your** ” means you as the user
of the Services. If you use the Services on behalf of a company or other
entity then “you” includes you and that entity, and you represent and warrant
that (a) you are an authorized representative of the entity with the authority
to bind the entity to these Terms, and (b) you agree to these Terms on the
entity’s behalf.

> **Section 9 contains an arbitration clause and class action waiver. By
> agreeing to these Terms, you agree (a) to resolve all disputes with us
> related to the Services through binding individual arbitration (unless
> expressly provided otherwise in Section 9), which means that you waive any
> right to have those disputes decided by a judge or jury, and (b) to waive
> your right to participate in class actions, class arbitrations, or
> representative actions in connection with your use of the Services. You have
> the right to opt-out of arbitration as explained in Section 9.**

### 1\. SERVICES; WALLETS; ACCOUNTS

  1. _Description of the Services_. The Services offer a unique metaverse gaming experience via the Game and other related experiences through the combination of traditional core game and blockchain mechanics via the Solana blockchain (the “**Star Atlas Metaverse** ”). The Star Atlas Metaverse is driven by a dual token system — “ATLAS” and “POLIS.” ATLAS serves as the native in-Game currency used for in-Game economic interactions, such as purchasing resources, ships, repairs, stations, and other in-Game assets. POLIS is a multifunctional governance token, which has applications both in-Game and in influencing decision making by the decentralized autonomous organization that governs the Star Atlas Metaverse (the “**Star Atlas DAO** ”). Further information about the Star Atlas DAO can be accessed at the website <https://govern.staratlas.com>. While we may provide services to the Star Atlas DAO at its request to create, facilitate, or service certain aspects of the Star Atlas Metaverse, we do not control the Star Atlas DAO and are not responsible for its decisions or actions. You acknowledge and agree that we cannot be held liable or responsible in any way for any damages or losses incurred by any person in connection with any acts or omissions of the Star Atlas DAO. Further details on the Star Atlas Metaverse, including the uses of ATLAS and POLIS, are set forth in the Star Atlas Economics whitepaper, currently available at <https://staratlas.com/assets/pdfs/economics-paper.pdf>, as we may update from time to time.
  2. _DACs_. The Star Atlas Metaverse utilizes a guild system that allows you to create factions and collectives that operate within the Star Atlas Metaverse in a decentralized, autonomous way (“**Decentralized Autonomous Corporations** ”). The Services may provide you and other players with certain tools that enable the implementation and management of such Decentralized Autonomous Corporations. We reserve the right to revoke access from any Decentralized Autonomous Corporation, or member player thereof, to such tools in the event that such Decentralized Autonomous Corporation or player violates these Terms or for any other reason we determine in our good faith business judgment.
  3. _Game Items_. The Services provide access to a marketplace (the “**Marketplace** ”) for you to purchase, transfer, and trade Game-related items such as ships, stations, resources, posters, and other items (collectively with other Game-related assets, attributes, or characteristics, whether or not transferable or tradeable, “**Game Items** ”); provided that any Game Items that we indicate are “soulbound” to you shall be non-transferable and non-tradable (including with respect to any Game NFTs associated with such Game Items) from the Digital Wallet or Account, as the case may be, that such Game Items are first stored (“**Soulbound Items** ”). Game Items can be used in the Services in various ways that we or the Star Atlas DAO make available, such as to represent in-Game assets that you can use while you play the Game. We make no promises or guarantees regarding the functionality, utility, or value of any Game Items, and such Game Items may evolve and change as we or the Star Atlas DAO update and modify the Game and the Star Atlas Metaverse.
  4. _Game NFTs_. Your purchase of Game Items may be accompanied by non-fungible tokens (“**NFTs** ”), and your ownership of these NFTs is tracked via the Solana blockchain (“**Game NFTs** ”). Your ownership of these Game NFTs will give you certain rights and privileges within the Services, for as long as we make the Services and such rights and privileges available to you. You are responsible for all payments, fees, and costs when engaging in any transactions involving Game NFTs, including, without limitation, the purchase price, transaction fees, fees associated with your secondary or subsequent sales of Game NFTs, and all other fees associated with your use of the Game NFTs via the Services.
  5. _Marketplace_. We provide the Marketplace to be able to sell Game Items and other Services-related offerings (collectively, “**Offerings** ”) to you directly from us. The Marketplace will also facilitate peer-to-peer sales conducted via decentralized or third-party exchanges or protocols whereby buyers and sellers can buy, sell, and trade Game NFTs (other than Soulbound Items) with each other. We may charge a transaction fee on all peer-to-peer sales that occur via the Marketplace or that otherwise involve Game NFTs (which may be calculated as a percentage of the overall sale price of the Game Items). We may offer ways to receive a discount on such transaction fees, such as by holding or staking certain Services-related tokens and assets. The scope of, and pre-requisitions for receiving any, such discount offers are subject to change by us in our sole discretion at any time. To facilitate transactions via the Marketplace, we have integrated with one or more third-party exchanges and services, or other decentralized smart contract protocols. These protocols facilitate, on a peer-to-peer basis, the exchange of cryptocurrency and other assets through the Solana blockchain. We do not own or control these third-party or decentralized services, we do not control the transfer of cryptocurrency or digital assets, including Game NFTs, using these third-party services or decentralized services, and we do not have the ability to cancel or reverse transactions via the Marketplace. You acknowledge and agree that, to the extent that you transfer, trade, or receive, or attempt to transfer or trade or receive, a Soulbound Item, in each case the Services will not associate the Soulbound Item with the recipient or any person that has a different Digital Wallet or Account, as the case may be, than that under which the Soulbound Item was first obtained. Except as may otherwise be provided in these Terms, we do not control or endorse purchases or sales of Game NFTs or other Offerings outside of the Services, including the Marketplace. With respect to Game NFTs that are not sold directly by us, we are not a party to any agreement entered into between an end user buyer and a seller on the Marketplace. Other than with respect to items sold directly by us, we have no control over the conduct of buyers, sellers, and any other users of the Marketplace. We accept no liability for any aspect of the buyer and seller peer-to-peer interaction on the Marketplace.
  6. _Digital Wallets_. To use certain of the Services, you need to link to the Services via a non-custodial digital wallet made available by either us (a “**Star Atlas Wallet** ”) or one or more third parties (a “**Third-Party Wallet** ”), and that is compatible with the Solana network and the Services (each, a “**Digital Wallet** ”). A list of supported wallets may be displayed by us, such as on the Website. Linking a Digital Wallet to the Services is required to be able to purchase, store, and engage in certain transactions using the Services, such as to connect your Game NFTs and ATLAS and POLIS tokens with the Services. We may not be able to help you recover assets associated with your Digital Wallet, as these are non-custodial wallets in your control. We do not own or control the assets associated with your Digital Wallet. We accept no responsibility or liability to you in connection with your use of a Digital Wallet and make no representations or warranties regarding how the Services will operate with any specific Digital Wallet. The private keys, credentials, passwords, seed phrases, or secret recovery passphrases necessary to decrypt or gain access to a Digital Wallet are held solely by you, and not by us. If you choose to transfer items from one Digital Wallet to another, such transfers will occur on the public blockchain and we accept no liability or responsibility for any such transfer, including for any loss, data corruption, or other negative impact that may occur to your Offerings or Digital Wallets or other assets when attempting to transfer assets between Digital Wallets. We reserve the right, with or without prior notice and in our sole and complete discretion, to discontinue, modify, or limit the operation of any Digital Wallet with the Services. You represent and warrant that you are the lawful owner of any Digital Wallet and that you are using that Digital Wallet under the terms and conditions of the applicable provider of the Digital Wallet. 
    1. To the extent that you use a Third-Party Wallet, the following additional terms apply: Third-Party Wallets are not associated with, maintained by, controlled by, or affiliated with us. If you have any issues with your Third-Party Wallet, please contact the applicable provider. You represent and warrant that you are the lawful owner of any Third-Party Wallet and that you are using that Third-Party Wallet under the terms and conditions of the applicable provider of the Third-Party Wallet.
    2. To the extent that you use a Star Atlas Wallet made available by us, such use will also be governed by the terms of use for the Star Atlas Wallet located in Appendix A of these Terms.
  7. _Promotional Codes_. We may offer certain promotional codes, referral codes, discount codes, coupon codes, or similar offers (“**Promotional Codes** ”) that may be redeemed for discounts on future Offerings, or other features or benefits related to the Services, subject to any additional terms that the Company establishes. You agree that Promotional Codes: (a) must be used in a lawful manner; (b) must be used for the intended audience and purpose; (c) may not be duplicated, sold, or transferred in any manner, or made available by you to the general public (whether posted to a public forum, coupon collecting service, or otherwise), unless expressly permitted by the Company; (d) may be disabled or have additional conditions applied to them by the Company at any time for any reason without liability to the Company; (e) may only be used pursuant to the specific terms that the Company establishes for such Promotional Code; (f) are not valid for cash or other credits or points; and (g) may expire prior to your use.
  8. _Changes and Pricing_. We may, at any time, revise or change the pricing, availability, specifications, content, descriptions, or features of any Offerings sold by us, and to correct pricing errors that may inadvertently occur (and to cancel any orders in our sole discretion that were purchased with pricing errors). All such changes shall be effective immediately upon posting of such new Offerings prices to the Services. While we attempt to be as accurate as we can in our descriptions for the Offerings, we do not warrant that Offerings descriptions are accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. The inclusion of any Offerings for purchase through the Services at a particular time does not imply or warrant that the Offerings will be available at any other time. We reserve the right to change prices for Offerings displayed on the Services at any time.
  9. _Purchases Made for Consumptive Use_. You acknowledge and affirm that you are acquiring Offerings, whether through the Marketplace or otherwise through the Services, for purposes of use in connection with the Services and, in the case of the Game NFTs, to play the Game or for other collectible purposes, and in each case not for any investment or speculative purposes. Any economic benefit that may be derived from appreciation in the value of an Offering or Game NFT is incidental to obtaining it for its use in connection with the Services or its collectible purpose.
  10. _ALL SALES FINAL_. ALL PURCHASES MADE THROUGH THE SERVICES ARE FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE, EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR REGULATION (AND IN SUCH INSTANCES WHERE REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE COMPANY’S ABILITY TO ISSUE ANY SUCH REFUND IS LIMITED TO WHETHER THE APPLICABLE SMART CONTRACT ENABLES THE COMPANY TO REASONABLY REVERSE OR CANCEL A TRANSACTION). NEVERTHELESS, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE COMPANY DOES NOT IN MOST CASES HAVE THE ABILITY TO REVERSE OR CANCEL A TRANSACTION AND IS NOT REQUIRED OR OBLIGATED TO PROVIDE A REFUND OF ANY PURCHASE FOR ANY REASON, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER COMPENSATION FOR TIME, ITEMS, AMOUNTS, OR VALUES IN A GAME ACCOUNT (INCLUDING ANY UNUSED OR PARTIAL USED MEMBERSHIP TIME), EVEN IF AN ACCOUNT IS CLOSED, WHETHER SUCH CLOSURE WAS VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY.

### 2\. LOCATION OF OUR PRIVACY POLICY AND OTHER TERMS

  2. _Privacy Policy_. Our Privacy Policy describes how we handle the information you provide to us when you use the Services. For an explanation of our privacy practices, please visit our Privacy Policy located at <https://staratlas.com/privacy-policy>.
  3. _Other Terms_. In connection with your use of the Services, you also agree to abide by the following other Services-related policies: our Discord Rules and our Community Guidelines (as presented to you if you join our Discord channel) and the Terms of Service applicable to the Star Atlas DAO (located at <https://govern.staratlas.com/terms-of-service>).

### 3\. ELIGIBILITY; RIGHTS WE GRANT YOU; USAGE LIMITATIONS

  3. _Eligibility_. You must be 13 years of age or older to use the Services. Additional aspects of the Services may have further age restrictions that will be presented to you in connection with those Services. Minors under the age of majority in their jurisdiction but that are at least 13 years of age are only permitted to use the Services if the minor’s parent or guardian or other holder of parental authority accepts these Terms on the minor’s behalf prior to use of the Services. Children under the age of 13 are not permitted to use the Services. You cannot use the Services if (1) the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Treasury Department lists you as a specially designated national and/or blocked person; (2) the Bureau of Industry and Security of the United States Department of Commerce lists you on its denied persons list or lists of parties of concern; or (3) you’re on any similar list promulgated by an official agency or department of the United States government. Further, if you use the Services, you may not transfer or provide to us any currency, digital assets, or other items that have been derived from any illegal or unlawful activity. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you meet these all requirements.
  4. _User Account_. Though your linked Digital Wallet will function as a unique identifier for you in respect of your use of certain portions of the Services, we may additionally require you to create an account in order to use certain portions of the Services (to the extent applicable, your “**Account** ”). To the extent that we require you to create an Account, we will provide you with instructions on how to do so, and once created, how to access, edit, and update your Account. In your creation, editing, or updating of any such Account, you agree to provide us with accurate, complete, and updated information. You are solely responsible for any activity on your Account and for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your password. We are not liable for any acts or omissions by you in connection with your Account. 
  5. _License Grants_. 
    1. _Software_. Subject to your compliance with these Terms, the Company hereby grants to you, a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-sublicensable, non-transferrable, and non-exclusive license to access and use the software provided to you as part of the Services (and, to the extent we offer you any software for download as part of the Services (such as the Game client or Star Atlas Wallet), to download, install, and execute a single copy of such software onto the equipment or device specified or approved by us). This license has the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided by us, in the manner permitted by these Terms, and subject to the use restrictions described below. Your access and use of the Services may be interrupted from time to time for any of several reasons, including, without limitation, the malfunction of equipment, periodic updating, maintenance, or repair of the Services or other actions that Company, in its sole discretion, may elect to take.
    2. _User Services_. We understand that part of what makes our community so great is its interest in developing tools and services that are helpful for other users of our Services and expand the Star Atlas Metaverse, such as guild directories, Game-related guides, or other Game-related creative content (“**User Services** ”). This Section 3.3(b) sets out your permissions, as part of your User Services, to reproduce and display certain Star Atlas audiovisual assets, artwork, images, and other content that is specifically designated as User Services Content at <https://build.staratlas.com/> (collectively, “**User Services Content** ”). The User Services Content does not include any audiovisual assets, artwork, or images that are not specifically designated as User Services Content. The User Services Content does not include the Star Atlas Marks (defined below, which include “STAR ATLAS” and the stylized STAR ATLAS and A logos); you may not use “STAR ATLAS” or any Star Atlas Marks in your User Services. The User Services do include, subject to use restrictions defined herein, certain other trademarks and logos, including the “STAR ATLAS: POWERED BY THE PEOPLE” mark. The User Services Content is a “Service” as defined in these Terms. The User Services Content does not include proprietary computer software programs or any items, assets, content, or other materials that we may make available to you in other ways. For example, Game Items, Game NFTs, or any other Offerings purchased via the Marketplace or otherwise through the Services are not User Services Content. 
      1. _User Services License_. Subject to your compliance with these Terms and applicable law, if you have developed a User Service that provides value to users of the Star Atlas Metaverse (as determined in our sole discretion), the Company hereby grants to you a personal, worldwide, non-assignable, non-sublicensable, non-transferrable, and non-exclusive right to reproduce, use, and display the User Services Content as part of your User Service to be able to identify User Services Content to users of User Services and/or as needed to identify that your User Service is related to the Star Atlas Metaverse, and provided that in all cases (unless expressly authorized in writing by the Company), such uses meet the requirements of this Section 3.3(b) and otherwise comply in all respects with any quality control guidelines that we may implement from time to time in our sole discretion (the “**User Services License** ”).
      2. _Prerequisites for Commercial Use of User Services Content_. Before you provide or otherwise make a copy of the User Service available publicly or to any other person or entity for commercial or for-profit purposes, you must give the Company notice of your intended distribution of the User Service as early as reasonably possible before the User Service is used to generate any revenue. You must give the Company the notice required under this section by submitting the release form found at [https://build.staratlas.com/](https://build.staratlas.com).
      3. _Special Permissions Required for Certain Commercial Uses of User Services Content_. You may not create User Services that incorporate gameplay on any electronic media (“**Electronic Games** ”), such as videogames, console games, PC games, and mobile app games, for a commercial purpose unless you obtain advance written permission and a custom license from us to create your Electronic Game. Unless you have obtained advance written permission and a custom license from us, you may create User Services that incorporate Electronic Games only for non-commercial and not for profit purposes, and subject to compliance with the rest of these Terms.
      4. _Royalties_. The User Services License is subject to the User Services Royalty Terms located in Appendix B of these Terms.
      5. _Interoperability Requirement_. If accepting payment in ATLAS and/or POLIS is feasible and practical for your User Service, you must accept such forms of payment. If incorporating the use of Game NFTs in your User Service is feasible and practical, you must incorporate such use in your User Service.
      6. _Proprietary Notices and Attribution_. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Company, you agree to ensure that all User Services and all artwork, packaging, labeling, copy, text, and all other written, printed, graphic, electronic, audio, or video advertising and promotional materials used or created for use in connection with any advertising and promotion of the User Services (“**Collateral** ”) using the User Services Content are prominently marked with: 
        1. the “STAR ATLAS: POWERED BY THE PEOPLE” logo located in Appendix C of these Terms;
        2. the following disclaimer: “**[Name of Your User Service] is inspired by Star Atlas. STAR ATLAS and STAR ATLAS: POWERED BY THE PEOPLE are trademarks or registered trademarks of ATMTA, Inc. in the United States of America and elsewhere.** ”;
        3. if the User Service has credits, the following notice in the credits: “**Star Atlas, Copyright [Insert Current Year], ATMTA, Inc. All rights reserved.** ”; and
        4. any applicable copyright and trademark, trademark, and other proprietary notices and disclaimers of the Company as they appear in the User Services Content.
      7. _General Restrictions_. You may not, directly or indirectly: 
        1. use or register for use, the User Services Content, or any element thereof, as part of (i) your corporate or trade name, or (ii) any domain name;
        2. use the User Services Content, or any element thereof, as the generic name of the User Services or any advertising and promotion related thereto;
        3. use any copyright or trademark notices that conflict with, confuse, or negate the notices provided by the Company and required by this Agreement on or in connection with the User Services;
        4. use any markings, legends, or notices on or in association with the User Services or their advertising and promotion other than as specified herein and as may from time to time be specified by the Company;
        5. use the User Services Content in a way that violates any applicable law or regulation;
        6. use the User Services Content in a way that would result in the User Services Content being rented or leased;
        7. use the User Services Content in a way that would result in a sale or grant of a security interest in any User Services Content;
        8. engage in any activity that could tarnish, dilute, or affect the validity or enforceability of the User Services Content or cause consumer confusion or diminish any goodwill relating to the Company or Star Atlas;
        9. imply official Company or Star Atlas partnership or endorsement beyond being officially licensed under these Terms;
        10. misappropriate any of our products or services; or
        11. support a claim by you or any third party that the User Services Content infringes a patent.
      8. _Reservation of Rights_. We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you under these Terms. No use of User Services Content in any medium or manner will be deemed to interfere with the limited permissions made to you by the Company herein, including: (a) the Company’s or its designees’ exploitation of products similar or identical to the User Services and products directly or indirectly competitive with the User Services and (b) granting other licenses or rights to exploit the User Services Content. The Company further reserves all rights at any time and in our sole discretion to revoke the User Services License granted in this section and require that you discontinue any use or reproduction of any User Services Content, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade names, slogans, logos, images, or other proprietary notations, and you agree to immediately comply with such requirement. 
    3. _Game NFTs_. When you purchase a Game NFT, you own the NFT as a token on the blockchain, but you do not own any intellectual property rights in the related Star Atlas audiovisual assets, artwork, images for Game Items, and other Services-related content and content derived from the Services (“**Content** ”) associated with such NFT except for the license grants expressly set forth herein. If you purchase or otherwise lawfully acquire a Game NFT, then subject to your compliance with these Terms, the Company hereby grants you a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license to use, copy, and display the Content that is specifically associated with such purchased Game NFT, and solely for the following purposes: (a) for your own non-commercial and not-for-profit use within or related to the Services and not otherwise in conflict with these Terms or any other Services-related policies (e.g., not to create and sell merchandise related to such Content); (b) as part of the Marketplace and any other marketplace that permits the purchase and sale of your Game NFTs, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies that only the actual owner can display the Content in connection with their sale of their Game NFT; or (c) as part of a third-party website or application that permits the display, inclusion, involvement, or participation of your Game NFT, provided that the website/application cryptographically verifies each Game NFT’s ownership of the Game NFT to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Content, and provided that the Content is no longer visible once the owner of the Game NFT leaves the website/application. This license only lasts as long as you are the valid owner and holder of the Game NFT associated with the licensed Content. If you sell or transfer the Game NFT to another person, this license will transfer to such other owner or holder of the Game NFT, and you will no longer have the benefits of such license. All rights not expressly granted are reserved.
  6. _Restrictions On Your Use of the Services_. You may not do, or assist others in doing, any of the following, unless applicable laws or regulations prohibit these restrictions or you have our written permission to do so: 
    1. download, modify, copy, distribute, transmit, translate, display, perform, reproduce, duplicate, publish, license, create derivative works from, or offer for sale any Content or other materials or information contained on, or obtained from or through, the Services, except as expressly authorized by Section 3.3(b) above;

    5. engage in any manipulative activity that violates the integrity of the prices of assets on the Marketplace, including (but not limited to) the manipulative tactics commonly known as spoofing and wash trading;
    6. access or use the Services in any manner that could disable, overburden, damage, disrupt, or impair the Services or interfere with any other party’s access to or use of the Services or use any device, software, or routine that causes the same;

### 8\. DISCLAIMERS; LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY; INDEMNIFICATION

  8. _DISCLAIMERS_. YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICES ARE AT YOUR OWN RISK. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO YOU ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, THE COMPANY, ITS PARENTS, AFFILIATES, RELATED COMPANIES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, REPRESENTATIVES, PARTNERS, AND LICENSORS (THE “**COMPANY ENTITIES** ”) DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. THE COMPANY ENTITIES MAKE NO WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION AND DISCLAIM ALL RESPONSIBILITY AND LIABILITY FOR: (A) THE COMPLETENESS, ACCURACY, AVAILABILITY, TIMELINESS, SECURITY, OR RELIABILITY OF THE SERVICES; (B) ANY HARM TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM, LOSS OF DATA, OR OTHER HARM THAT RESULTS FROM YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE SERVICES; (C) THE OPERATION OR COMPATIBILITY WITH ANY OTHER APPLICATION OR ANY PARTICULAR SYSTEM OR DEVICE; (D) WHETHER THE SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR BE AVAILABLE ON AN UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE BASIS; AND (E) THE DELETION OF, OR THE FAILURE TO STORE OR TRANSMIT, YOUR CONTENT, DATA, AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS MAINTAINED BY THE SERVICES. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED FROM THE COMPANY ENTITIES OR THROUGH THE SERVICES, WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION NOT EXPRESSLY MADE HEREIN. FOR CLARITY, WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER AND MAKE NO GUARANTEES OR PROMISES WITH RESPECT TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE SOLANA BLOCKCHAIN AND/OR THE EXECUTION OF SMART CONTRACTS AND/OR TRANSACTIONS THEREIN.
  9. _LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY_. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, YOU AGREE THAT IN NO EVENT WILL THE COMPANY ENTITIES BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, LOSS OF USE, DATA OR PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES), HOWEVER CAUSED AND UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER UNDER THESE TERMS OR OTHERWISE ARISING IN ANY WAY IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES OR THESE TERMS AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) EVEN IF THE COMPANY ENTITIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. SOME JURISDICTIONS (SUCH AS THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY) DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF THOSE JURISDICTIONS. THE COMPANY ENTITIES’ TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES FINALLY AWARDED SHALL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF (I) THE AMOUNT YOU PAID THE COMPANY ENTITIES, IF ANY, IN THE PAST SIX (6) MONTHS FOR THE SERVICES (OR OFFERINGS PURCHASED ON THE SERVICES) GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM, OR (II) $100 USD. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY EVEN IF THE ABOVE STATED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
  10. _Indemnification_. By entering into these Terms and accessing or using the Services, you agree that you shall defend, indemnify, and hold the Company Entities harmless from and against any and all claims, costs, damages, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys’ fees and costs) incurred by the Company Entities arising out of or in connection with: (a) your violation or breach of any term of these Terms or any applicable law or regulation; (b) your violation of any rights of any third party; (c) your access to or use of the Services; (d) Your Content; (e) your User Service; or (f) your negligence or willful misconduct.
  11. _Assumption of Risks_. You acknowledge and agree that there are risks associated with purchasing and holding NFTs and using blockchain technology. These include, but are not limited to, risk of losing access to NFTs due to loss of a PIN, wallet keys, seed phrases, two-factor authentication devices, or log-in information, user error when transferring NFTs, custodial error or purchaser error, smart contract error, risk of blockchain attacks, risk of hacking and security weaknesses, risk of unfavorable regulatory intervention in one or more jurisdictions, risks related to token taxation, risk of personal information disclosure, risk of uninsured losses, unanticipated risks, and volatility risks. You acknowledge that you have obtained sufficient information to make an informed decision to purchase a Game NFT, including carefully reviewing the code of the smart contract and the NFT, and fully understand and accept the functions of the same. The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Services, and therefore the potential utility or value of your Game NFTs. Upgrades to any blockchain network or hard forks in such networks, or a change in how transactions are confirmed on such blockchain networks, may have unintended, adverse effects on all blockchains, including any that are related to your Game NFTs.
  12. _Taxes_. You are solely responsible to pay any and all sales, use, value-added, and other taxes, duties, and assessments (except taxes on our net income) now or hereafter claimed or imposed by any governmental authority associated with your use of the Services. Except for income taxes levied on us, you: (a) will be solely responsible for reporting any tax obligations when, if ever, such obligations arise as a result of your use of the Services or in relation to an Offering; (b) will pay or reimburse Company for all national, federal, state, local, or other taxes and assessments of any jurisdiction, including value added taxes and other taxes as may be required, and amounts levied in lieu thereof based on charges set, services performed, or payments made hereunder, as are now or hereafter may be imposed under the authority of any national, state, local, or any other taxing jurisdiction; and (c) will not be entitled to deduct the amount of any such taxes, duties, or assessments from payments (including transaction fees) made to us pursuant to these Terms. Neither these Terms nor any other communication from the Company constitutes tax advice, and users are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to their interaction with Offerings and the Services.
  13. _Force Majeure_. We will not be liable or responsible to you, nor be deemed to have defaulted under or breached these Terms, for any failure or delay in fulfilling or performing any of our obligations under these Terms or in operating the Services, when and to the extent such failure or delay is caused by or results from any events beyond the Company’s ability to control, including flood, fire, earthquake, epidemics, pandemics, quarantine restrictions, tsunami, explosion, war, invasion, hostilities (whether war is declared or not), terrorist threats or acts, riot or other civil unrest, government order, law, or action, embargoes or blockades, strikes, labor stoppages or slowdowns or other industrial disturbances, shortage of adequate or suitable Internet connectivity, telecommunication breakdown, shortage of adequate power or electricity, and other similar events beyond our control.

### 9\. GOVERNING LAW; ARBITRATION; CLASS ACTION WAIVER

  9. _Governing Law_. These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflict of laws rules, and the proper venue for any disputes arising out of or relating to any of the same will be the arbitration venue set forth herein, or if arbitration does not apply, then the state and federal courts located in New York. You and the Company agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to the interpretation or construction of these Terms.
  10. _Informal Process First_. You agree that in the event of any dispute between you and the Company Entities, you will first contact the Company and make a good faith sustained effort to resolve the dispute before resorting to more formal means of resolution, including without limitation, any court action or arbitration.
  11. _Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver_. After the informal dispute resolution process, any remaining dispute, controversy, or claim (collectively, “**Claim** ”), whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, or any other legal theory, relating in any way to your use of the Company’s services and/or products, including the Services, will be resolved by arbitration, including the resolution of threshold questions as to the arbitrability of the Claim. YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT “Claim” AS DEFINED IN THESE TERMS SHALL NOT INCLUDE ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT, MISAPPROPRIATION, DILUTION, OR OTHER MISUSE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. **You and the Company agree that any Claim will be settled by final and binding arbitration, using the English language, administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “Rules”) then in effect (those rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this section, and as of the date of these Terms). Any arbitration under these Terms will take place on an individual basis in accordance with the Rules. Class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, YOU AND THE COMPANY ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR CLASS ARBITRATION.** You and Company further agree: (i) to arbitrate all Claims between the parties pursuant to the provisions in these Terms; (ii) these Terms memorialize a transaction in interstate commerce; and (iii) the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq.) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Section. The arbitrator’s decision(s) shall be made pursuant to the Rules and will be final and binding. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim, or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of these Terms as permitted by the governing New York law and subject to the terms and limitations in these Terms. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing agreement to arbitration: 
    1. _Injunctive Relief_. You and the Company will have the right to bring an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable or conservatory relief, pending a final decision by the arbitrator.
    2. _Small Claims_. Any Claim which is eligible for resolution in the small claims court (or its equivalent) of the jurisdiction in which the party bringing the claim is domiciled may be brought in such small claims court or its equivalent **on an individual, non-representative, and non-class basis**. If a party initiating such a Claim is domiciled outside of the United States or in a jurisdiction which does not have small claims courts or their equivalent, any claim for less than $5000 USD may be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction in the jurisdiction in which the party initiating the Claim is domiciled.
  12. _Confidentiality_. You and Company agree that any Claim that has been submitted to arbitration, and all related proceedings, including any settlement agreement, shall be kept confidential. In the event you or the Company file the arbitration award with any court of competent jurisdiction in order to have that award confirmed in a court order or judgment, or any other proceeding under the Federal Arbitration Act, then each party shall take measures to the extent permitted by applicable law to redact or file under seal any highly sensitive business or personal information that appear in the award and any other supporting documents filed in such a proceeding.
  13. _Conduct of the Arbitration_. Any arbitration will be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator appointed in accordance with the Rules, except that, if the amount in dispute exceeds $10 million USD, the arbitration shall be conducted by a panel of three neutral arbitrators appointed in accordance with the Rules. The arbitration shall have its seat in New York. The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by videoconference (which you may join telephonically if you are unable to reasonably access or utilize videoconference technology), rather than by personal appearances, during ordinary business hours in the time zone in which the party initiating the arbitration resides. The arbitrator may direct that the hearing be held in person upon the request of any party if the arbitrator concludes that doing so would be appropriate under the circumstances. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination should be made by the arbitrator. For the avoidance of doubt, the arbitration shall be deemed to take place in New York, and any resulting award(s) will be rendered in New York, regardless of the location or method of any hearings.
  14. _**Opt-Out**_. **You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration provisions set forth in these Terms by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to[legal@staratlas.com](mailto:legal@staratlas.com) or by certified mail to the U.S. mailing address listed in the “How to Contact Us” section of these Terms. The notice must be sent to the Company within thirty (30) days of your registering to use the Services or agreeing to these Terms, whichever is earlier, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with these Terms. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, the Company also will not be bound by them.**

### 10\. ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS

  10. _Updating These Terms_. We may modify these Terms from time to time in which case we will update the “Last Revised On” date at the top of these Terms. If we make changes that are material, we will use reasonable efforts to attempt to notify you. However, it is your sole responsibility to review these Terms from time to time to view any such changes. The updated Terms will be effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the updated Terms. Your continued access or use of the Services after the modifications have become effective will be deemed your acceptance of the modified Terms.
  11. _Termination of License and Your Account_. If you breach any of the provisions of these Terms, all licenses granted by the Company will terminate automatically. Additionally, the Company may suspend, disable, or delete your Account and/or the Services (or any part of the foregoing) with or without notice, for any or no reason. If the Company deletes your Account for any suspected breach of these Terms by you, you are prohibited from re-registering for the Services under a different name or wallet address. In the event of Account deletion for any reason, the Company may, but is not obligated to, delete any of Your Content. The Company shall not be responsible for the deletion of or failure to delete Your Content. All sections which by their nature should survive the termination of these Terms shall continue in full force and effect subsequent to and notwithstanding any termination of these Terms by the Company or you. Termination will not limit any of the Company’s other rights or remedies at law or in equity.
  12. _Injunctive Relief_. You agree that a breach of these Terms will cause irreparable injury to the Company for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and the Company shall be entitled to equitable relief in addition to any remedies it may have hereunder or at law without a bond, other security, or proof of damages.
  13. _California Residents_. If you are a California resident, in accordance with Cal. Civ. Code § 1789.3, you may report complaints to the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by contacting them in writing at 1625 North Market Blvd., Suite N 112 Sacramento, CA 95834, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210.
  14. _Export Laws_. You agree that you will not export or re-export, directly or indirectly, the Services and/or other information or materials provided by the Company hereunder, to any country for which the United States or any other relevant jurisdiction requires any export license or other governmental approval at the time of export without first obtaining such license or approval. In particular, but without limitation, the Services may not be exported or re-exported (a) into any U.S. embargoed countries or any country that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country, or (b) to anyone listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties, including the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Department of Commerce Denied Person’s List or Entity List. You warrant and represent that you’re not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any embargoed country. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you are not located in any such country or on any such list. You are responsible for and hereby agree to comply at your sole expense with all applicable United States export laws and regulations.
  15. _Miscellaneous_. If any provision of these Terms shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. These Terms and the licenses granted hereunder may be assigned by the Company but may not be assigned by you without the prior express written consent of the Company. No waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. Any act by the Company to exercise, or failure or delay in exercise of, any of its rights under these Terms, at law or in equity will not be deemed a waiver of those or any other rights or remedies available in contract, at law or in equity. The section headings used herein are for reference only and shall not be read to have any legal effect. The Services are operated by us in the United States. Those who choose to access the Services from locations outside the United States do so at their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws.

### APPENDIX

  1. Appendix A: Star Atlas Wallet Terms
  2. Appendix B: User Services Royalty Terms
  3. Appendix C: "Star Atlas: Powered by the People" Logo

### Appendix A: Star Atlas Wallet Terms

These Wallet Terms of Service (these “**Wallet Terms** ”) apply to your use of
our Star Atlas wallet application and browser extension (the “**Star Atlas
Wallet** ”) made available by or on behalf of ATMTA, Inc. (“**Company** ,”
“**we** ,” or “**us** ”), a Delaware corporation. The Star Atlas Wallet is a
“Service” as defined in the overall Terms of Service for the Star Atlas
website, game, and related services (“**Service Terms** ”). The Service Terms
are incorporated by reference into these Wallet Terms. Capitalized terms used
in these Wallet Terms but not defined herein will have the meaning set forth
in the Service Terms. In the event of a conflict between these Wallet Terms
and the rest of the Service Terms, these Wallet Terms will supersede and
control with respect to your access and use of the Star Atlas Wallet. By
accessing or using the Star Atlas Wallet, you agree to these Wallet Terms and
the overall Service Terms.

  1. _Wallet Services_ The Star Atlas Wallet is a digital wallet that is downloaded and accessible locally on your own device, and accessible locally by you on such device where you have installed the Star Atlas Wallet. The Star Atlas Wallet provides you with access to an interface that allows you to conduct certain transaction directly on the Solana blockchain network (or such additional blockchains as the Star Atlas Wallet may support from time to time), and to view balances of blockchain-based digital assets (collectively, “**Digital Assets** ”) associated with such the private keys for such Star Atlas Wallet.
  2. _Self-Custodial Wallet_ The Star Atlas Wallet is a “self-custodial” wallet in that you custody and control your own Digital Assets accessible through your Star Atlas Wallet. With respect to such Digital Assets, we do not own, control, or have custody of such Digital Assets, and we do not have the ability to transfer or recover such Digital Assets. We do not operate a Digital Asset exchange platform or offer trade execution or clearing services and, therefore, have no oversight, involvement, or control concerning your transactions using the Star Atlas Wallet.
  3. _Access_ The Star Atlas Wallet may require you to create a password to access your Digital Wallet. In certain circumstances, such as if you lose or forget your password for your Star Atlas Wallet, you may be able to use a recovery phrase or other secret information to access any cryptocurrency stored in your Star Atlas Wallet (each a “**Recovery Phrase** ”). Anyone who knows your Recovery Phrase may be able to access, transfer, or spend your Digital Assets. If you lose your Recovery Phrase, you may not be able to access, transfer, or spend your Digital Assets. **We do not have access or control over your password or Recovery Phrase or private key for your Star Atlas Wallet. You are solely responsible for the retention and security of your password or Recovery Phrase or private key for your Star Atlas Wallet.**
  4. _Gas Fees_ When conducting transactions via the Star Atlas Wallet, the applicable blockchain network charges a network fee for engaging in a transaction on the network, often referred to “gas fees.” Those gas fees fluctuate over time depending on a variety of factors. You are solely responsible for paying gas fees associated with transactions you engage in on the Solana blockchain network, or any other supported network, using the Star Atlas Wallet. You are also solely responsible for any other third-party fees that may be incurred in connection with your use of the Star Atlas Wallet.
  5. _Third-Party Services_ The Star Atlas Wallet may allow you to connect with third-party services and applications (“**Third-Party Services** ”). We do not have control over their content, do not warrant or endorse, and are not responsible for the availability or legitimacy of the content, products, or services on or accessible from those Third-Party Services (including any related website, resources, or links displayed therein). We make no warranties or representations, express or implied, about the manner in which the Star Atlas Wallet may function with such Third-Party Services.
  6. _Risks of Decryption_ Although the Star Atlas Wallet cryptographically encrypts your private information when using the Star Atlas Wallet, you acknowledge and understand that technical advances such as the development of quantum computers may present risks to Digital Assets, cryptocurrencies, and encryption in general, which could result in the theft or loss of your cryptographic tokens or property. By using the Star Atlas Wallet, you acknowledge these inherent risks.
  7. _Modifications or Discontinuance_ We may modify, or discontinue support for, the Star Atlas Wallet at any time. In the event of a change to an underlying blockchain network, or other network disruption, resulting in a fork of the existing blockchain into one (or more) additional blockchains, the Star Atlas Wallet may not support activity related to any new Digital Assets created as a result of the fork.

### Appendix B: User Services Royalty Terms

If you develop a User Service under Section 3.3(b) of the overall Terms of
Service (the "**Service Terms** "), you must additionally comply with these
User Services Royalty Terms (these "**Royalty Terms** "). The Service Terms
are incorporated by reference into these Royalty Terms. Capitalized terms used
in these Royalty Terms but not defined herein will have the meaning set forth
in the Service Terms. In the event of a conflict between these Royalty Terms
and the rest of the Service Terms, these Royalty Terms will supersede and
control with respect to your User Services. By accessing or using the User
Services Content, you agree to these Royalty Terms and the overall Service
Terms.

  1. _Definitions_. For purposes of these Royalty Terms, the terms set forth below are defined as follows: 
    1. The term "**Allowed Exclusion** " has the meaning set forth in Section 1.2 of these Royalty Terms.
    2. The term "**Gross Revenue** " means all worldwide gross revenue directly generated in connection with, related to, or otherwise attributable to each User Service, regardless of who receives the revenue and regardless of whether you distribute the User Service to end users directly, self-publish via an app store or any similar store, or work with a publisher or distributor. Gross Revenue includes, without limitation, any amounts: 
      1. realized in fiat and/or non-fiat currency, including virtual currency, by you or any other person or entity;
      2. resulting from or related to any and all sales of a User Service to end users through any and all media, including but not limited to digital and retail;
      3. resulting from or related to any and all in-product purchases, downloadable content, microtransactions, subscriptions, sale, transfer, or exchange of user-generated content for use with a User Service, or redemption of virtual currency which directly affects the operation of the User Service, whether redeemed within the User Service or externally;
      4. from any Kickstarter or other crowdfunding campaign which is directly associated with User Service access or in-User Service benefit;
      5. from in-product advertising and affiliate programs;
      6. from any advance payments for a User Service (from a publisher or otherwise);
      7. from initial or subsequent on-platform or off-platform sales or exchanges of NFTs or similar blockchain related products;
      8. received in connection with a User Service's inclusion in a streaming, subscription, or other game-delivery service (e.g., Apple Arcade, Microsoft GamePass, or any similar or successor services), including without limitation development funds and bonuses; and
      9. received in any other form actually attributable to a User Service.
    3. The term "**Royalty Payment** " means the Royalty Revenue for each User Service multiplied by the Royalty Rate of the corresponding industry category. If a User Service generates revenue in multiple categories, the Royalty Payment is the sum of the revenue generated in each industry category multiplied by the corresponding Royalty Rate.
    4. The term "**Royalty Rate** " means the applicable rate set forth in the table below for each User Service: 

Industry | Product | Description | Royalty Rate  
---|---|---|---  
**Software** | _Entertainment_ | Provides an entertainment product or service.   
Note: Electronic Games require pre-approval and a custom license that will be subject to a custom royalty rate. See Section 3.3(b)(iii) | 5%  
_System Application_ | Provides a product or service-based application | 4%  
**Media** | _Books/Comics_ | Includes literature | 3%

    5. The term **"Royalty Revenue"** means Gross Revenue minus any Allowed Exclusions for each User Service, regardless of whether that Gross Revenue is received by you or any other person or entity.
  2. _Allowed Exclusions_. The following Gross Revenue (each an "**Allowed Exclusion** ") is excluded from the calculation of Royalty Revenue. 
    1. _Lifetime Exclusion_. You will not owe the Company any royalty payments until the User Service generates more than $1,000,000 USD in lifetime Gross Revenue. The first $1,000,000 USD in Gross Revenue for each User Service is excluded from the calculation of Royalty Revenue.
    2. _Double-Payment Exclusion_. You will not owe the Company any royalty payments for an advance payment of revenue for a User Service that is recoupable by the payer, such as a publisher. Such royalty payments made by you may be credited against future royalty payments that you incur under these Royalty Terms for that User Service.
    3. _Other Exclusions_. The following are also excluded from the calculation of Royalty Revenue: 
      1. Revenue generated solely from activity in the Game or on the Marketplace;
      2. Cash Prizes given with awards earned for the User Service;
      3. Revenue from donations for a User Service which are not tied to the User Service; 
      4. Funding you receive from the Company; and
      5. Revenue from a User Service that is used, displayed, and performed solely at a physical location under your control or the control of your authorized distributors and that is not otherwise distributed to users.
  3. _Conversion to United States Dollars_. Gross Revenue realized in non-USD currencies shall be converted to USD at the officially published monthly average exchange rates of the month in which such Gross Revenue was earned (using rates published by an international bank or recognized exchange rate website—www.oanda.com, www.x-rates.com, www.xe.com). Gross Revenue realized in virtual currencies shall be converted to USD at the officially published time weighted monthly average exchange rates of the month in which such Gross Revenue was earned (using rates published by www.coinmarketcap.com, www.coingecko.com, or other exchange sites as approved by the Company).
  4. _Reporting and Payment Terms_. Within 45 days after the end of each calendar half (i.e., on February 13 and August 14) in which you earn Royalty Revenue, you must report the Royalty Revenue to the Company on a per-User Service basis and pay the Company the Royalty Payment. Additional information on reporting and payment can be found at [https://build.staratlas.com/](https://build.staratlas.com). The Company reserves the right to charge a 2% late fee, per calendar half (compounding), for any amounts unpaid after the required due date. Except to the extent required by applicable law, all payments, fees and royalties are non-refundable under all circumstances. All Royalty Payments shall be payable in United States Dollars (USD). All payments made by you to ATMTA will be sent by wire transfer to the account of the Company's choosing, which account may be changed from time to time on written notice from the Company to you. To obtain current wire transfer information, contact the Company via email at [legal@staratlas.com](mailto:legal@staratlas.com) with the subject "Royalty Payments."
  5. _Taxes_. You are responsible for all taxes on all payments required to be made by you under these Terms (other than taxes that the Company is obligated to pay on its income, which are the Company's responsibility). If you are required by a government agency to reduce your payment to the Company for any reason, you are required to provide sufficient documentation to the Company supporting the withholding. The Company cannot answer your questions about withholding taxes or taxes in general.
  6. _Records and Audits_. You agree to keep accurate books and records related to your development, manufacture, distribution, and sale of User Services and related revenue. The Company may conduct reasonable audits of those books and records. Audits will be conducted during business hours on reasonable prior notice to you. The Company will bear the costs of audits unless the results show a shortfall in payments in excess of 5% during the period audited, in which case you will be responsible for the cost of the audit.
