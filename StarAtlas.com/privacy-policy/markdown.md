# Privacy Policy

**_Last Revised on August 1, 2022_**

We are committed to respecting and protecting your privacy and complying with
any applicable law and regulation regarding your personal information. This
Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your
personal information, including across our website <https://staratlas.com/>
(the "**Website** "), the Star Atlas game, and all other content and
functionality accessible via our Website and the Star Atlas game other than
the Star Atlas DAO (as defined below) (collectively, the “**Services** ”), in
each case operated by or on behalf of ATMTA, Inc. (“**we** ,” “**us** ,”
“**our** ”), a Delaware corporation.

For information regarding the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of
your personal information with regard to content and functionality offered by
the decentralized autonomous organization that governs the Star Atlas game and
metaverse and which is accessible at the website
<https://govern.staratlas.com> (the “**Star Atlas DAO** ”), please refer to
the Privacy Policy applicable to the Star Atlas DAO (located at
<https://govern.staratlas.com/privacy-policy>).

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. If you do not agree with this
Privacy Policy in general or any part of it, you should not access the
Website, use our Services, or otherwise provide your information to us.

## Information We Collect

Information we collect falls into one of two categories: “automatically
collected” information and “voluntarily provided” information.

“Automatically collected” information refers to any information automatically
sent by your devices in the course of accessing our Services.

“Voluntarily provided” information refers to any information you knowingly and
actively provide us when using or participating in any of our Services.

## Automatically Collected Information

_Log Data_

When you visit our Services, our servers may automatically log the standard
data provided by your web browser. It may include your device’s Internet
Protocol (IP) address, geolocation data, your browser type and version, the
pages you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on each page,
the referring site, website elements clicked, and other details about your
visit.

Additionally, if you encounter certain errors while using the site, we may
automatically collect data about the error and the circumstances surrounding
its occurrence. This data may include technical details about your device,
what you were trying to do when the error happened, and other technical
information relating to the problem. You may or may not receive notice of such
errors, even in the moment they occur, that they have occurred, or what the
nature of the error is.

Please be aware that while this information may not be personally identifying
by itself, it may be possible to combine it with other data to personally
identify individual persons.

_Device Data_

When you visit our website or interact with our Services, we may automatically
collect data about your device, such as:

  * Device Type
  * Operating System

## Voluntarily Provided Information

_Personal Information_

We may ask for personal information — for example, when you register an
account, make a purchase, request support for our Services, or when you
otherwise contact us, including on Discord — which may include one or more of
the following:

  * Name
  * Email address
  * Discord username, if you interact with us there
  * Digital Asset Wallet Address
  * Other information necessary for Anti-Money Laundering (“**AML** ”), Counter Financing of Terrorism (“**CFT** ”), and Know Your Customer (“**KYC** ”) compliance purposes
  * Any other information you choose to provide, such as when you fill in a form, file a support ticket, provide screenshots, conduct a search, update or add information to your account, respond to surveys, participate in promotions, correspond with us, or use other features of our Services.

## Third-Party Information

We may combine voluntarily provided and automatically collected personal
information with information that is publicly available (such as on social
media) or that you provide to third parties that they share with us. For
example, we obtain your Digital Asset Transaction History, as it relates to
Star Atlas tokens, from your wallet provider.

## Collection and Use of Information

We may collect personal information from you when you do any of the following
on our Services:

  * Register for an account
  * Use a mobile device, personal computer, or web browser to access our Services
  * Contact us via email, social media, chat programs, or on any similar technologies

purposes:

  * to enable you to customize or personalize your experience of our Services
  * to operate, improve, and develop our Services
  * to contact and communicate with you
  * to enable you to access and use our Services, associated interactive features, associated applications, and associated social media or chat platforms 
  * to comply with our legal obligations and resolve any disputes that we may have
  * for security and fraud prevention, and to ensure that our sites and apps are safe, secure, and used in line with our Terms of Use

## Security of Your Personal Information

When we collect and process personal information, and while we retain this
information, we will protect it within commercially acceptable means to
prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying,
use, or modification.

Although we will implement and maintain practices to protect the personal
information you provide to us, we advise that no method of electronic
transmission or storage is 100% secure, and no one can guarantee absolute data
security. We recommend that you do not use unsecure channels to communicate
sensitive or confidential information to us. Any information you transmit to
us you do at your own risk.

You are responsible for selecting any password, to the extent one is required,
and its overall security strength, ensuring the security of your own
information within the bounds of our services. For example, you are
responsible for ensuring any passwords associated with accessing your personal
information and accounts are secure and confidential.

## How Long We Keep Your Personal Information

We keep your personal information only for as long as we need to. This time
period may depend on what we are using your information for, in accordance
with this Privacy Policy. For example, if you have provided us with personal
information as part of creating an account with us, we may retain this
information for the duration your account exists on our system. If your
personal information is no longer required for this purpose, we will delete it
or make it anonymous by removing all details that identify you.

## Children's Privacy

We do not aim any of our Services directly at children under the age of 13,
and we do not knowingly collect personal information about children under 13.
If we become aware that we have unknowingly collected information about a
child under 13 years of age, we will make commercially reasonable efforts to
delete such information from our database.

If you are the parent or guardian of a child under 13 years of age who has
provided us with their personal information, you may contact us using the
below information to request that it be deleted.

## Disclosure of Personal Information to Third Parties

We may disclose personal information to third parties in the following
circumstances:

  * with our parent, subsidiary, and/or affiliated entities;

  * advertising partners;
  * our employees, contractors, and/or related entities;
  * credit reporting agencies, courts, tribunals, and regulatory authorities, in the event you fail to pay for goods or services we have provided to you;

  * to prevent physical harm, financial loss, or fraud on our Services; and
  * an entity that buys, or to which we transfer, all or substantially all of our assets and business.

information to third countries (i.e., the standard contractual clauses) (the
“**Model Clauses** ”), or any equivalent contracts issued by the relevant
competent authority of the UK, as relevant, unless the data transfer is to a
country that has been determined by the European Commission or the relevant UK
authorities, as applicable, to provide an adequate level of protection for
individuals’ rights and freedoms for their personal information. Please
contact us at _contact@staratlas.com_ should you wish to examine a copy of the
Model Clauses.
