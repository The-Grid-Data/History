# A Playful Adventure at the Toy Fair with Claynosaurz

03.10.2023Update

The Claynosaurz team, even amidst the preparations for Breakpoint and
organizing the new office, carved out a moment of playful exploration by
attending the Toy Fair in New York City.

Held at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center from September 30 to October 3,
2023, the Toy Fair was a playground of innovation and creativity. Recognized
as the most extensive play-focused conference, it showcased various products
from every conceivable angle of play.

The fair presented attendees with a unique edge, unveiling thousands of new
toys, games, edutainment products, and entertainment-driven experiences from
across the globe.

But the Toy Fair was not just a showcase. It emerged as a vibrant platform for
networking, connecting with industry professionals, forming valuable
partnerships, and staying abreast of the latest trends and innovations in the
toy and play industry.

And for Claynosaurz, it wasn’t solely about meetings, R&D, and seminars. It
was also a stage to showcase the Claynosaurz IP, sharing our playful world
with others.
