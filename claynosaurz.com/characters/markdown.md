A classic overachiever, Trix has been underestimated so much that she’s now
got something to prove. Loyal, nerdy, and a little socially awkward (but,
like, in an endearing way), she’s extremely competitive but the ultimate rule
follower.

Bex sucks at first impressions. A little too direct, monotone, and sarcastic,
she comes off a little standoffish..but once she likes you, you’ve got a
friend for life who will always stand up for you. She also sometimes scares
people due to her dark humor and taste - she’ll be the one to cheer at
explosions, or push others aside to poke a dead thing with a stick.

# Milo

A big (and big-hearted) goof, Milo is hardworking, friendly, and a cheerleader
for his best friends (especially Flea). Others often overlook Milo because of
his good nature and sense of childlike wonder, but he usually comes through in
ways that others rarely expect. He sometimes seems easy to take advantage of,
and as a result his friends are fiercely protective of him.

# Defender

Species

    Rex, Stego, Ankylo

Clay required

    WhiteGreenYellow

Bonus

    Endurance

 _“Protect at all costs.”_  
Defenders are the protectors; they stand up for what’s right, help others, and
also act as a defense in every way. Underestimating them would be a very
unwise decision.

# Mystic

Species

    Trice, Bronto, Stego

Clay required

    YellowBlackBlue

Bonus

    Magic

 _“All spells aren’t created equal.”_  
Little is known about how the mystics achieve their spells and powers, pulling
from unknown sources; powers, abilities and spells vary, but one thing is for
sure: you don’t want to be caught without a mystic in your corner.

# Warrior

Species

    Rex, Trice, Ankylo

Clay required

    WhiteGreenBlue

Bonus

    Strength

**'**_Brawn, Brains, and even more brawn._**'  
** Warrior-types usually lead the charge, but sometimes need to be reminded to
think before they react. If you hear the screams of a warrior, probably best
to run the opposite direction.

# Tracker

Species

    Raptor, Bronto, Trice

Clay required

    RedBlueBlack

Bonus

    Agility

 _“Compasses are for the weak”_  
Also known as scouts, trackers are integral to a herd - they have an innate
sense of direction, and can usually find anything they put their mind to. They
often need protection, because they tend to get so focused on what they’re
looking for, they forget what’s around them. You (usually) won’t be lost with
a tracker.

# Mender

Bonus

    Heal

 _“Problems happen!”_  
The Menders are the fixers - solving problems, repairing things, and helping
others is their m.o. Called in when they’re needed, they’re always
experimenting with new things - ready to be even more efficient. If you can
break it, you can mend it.

# Stalker

Clay required

    GreenWhiteRed

Bonus

    Speed

 _“What’s mine is mine, and what’s yours is…also mine.”_  
Stalkers are the sneakiest of the bunch. Excellent at surprises, silence and
stealing - they’ll grab your stuff so fast you’ll forget you even had it. Hold
on to your scales when a stalker is around.

# The Crimson Clan

The Crimson Clan are a crew of dino’s who have kind of sus motives. No one is
ever really sure of how they’ll act when encountered. Maybe they’ll help you
(usually if there’s something in it for them), or maybe they’ll shove your
face in the sand to get ahead. Tread carefully.

# The Bored Bunch

The Bored Bunch is pretty good at what they do, if you count looking chill and
vibing as “doing” something. They’re not lazy - things just need to be worth
their while, and it just so happens that not much usually is.
