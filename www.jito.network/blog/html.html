This article will summarize liquidity, how LPing works, risks, and different strategies you can implement based on portfolio goals.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"what-is-liquidity\"\u003eWhat is liquidity?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eLiquidity is the lubricant which makes markets work smoothly. In terms of trading, liquidity refers to how easily an asset can be bought or sold. If a market has high liquidity it means there are a lot of participants/capital, if a market has low liquidity there is a relative lack of participants/capital. For low liquidity markets difficulty for traders may emerge in the form of slippage. Since there is less capital/participants in low liquidity markets it is harder to find counterparties to match bid/asks so traders end up paying or selling higher or lower than mark price. This difference from mark price is called slippage, the idea being the amount your order caused the price to “slip” or change from mark. Another way difficulty could emerge would be in longer fill time. Improved liquidity allows markets to price more efficiently, supports stability and overall improves investor confidence.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"if-your-market-has-low-liquidity-what-do-you-do\"\u003eIf your market has low liquidity what do you do?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn traditional markets liquidity is improved by market-makers. Market-makers are firms that provide liquidity to assets so that traders always have a counterparty. Market-makers are incentivized to market make through the profit derived from the bid-ask spread, although for some markets extra incentives are contractually added such as reduced fees or exclusivity in order to encourage market making. Exchanges or assets will do this to improve asset liquidity, reduce volatility and overall support investor confidence.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn crypto there are thousands of assets with markets that are too small for traditional market makers to service. To address this the crypto ecosystem developed Automated Market Makers (AMMs).\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"what-is-an-amm\"\u003eWhat is an AMM?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnlike traditional market makers that rely on buy and sell orders to determine prices, Automated Market Makers (AMMs) utilize a mathematical formula to price assets automatically. By using liquidity pools instead of order books, AMMs enable decentralized trading by setting prices according to the current supply and demand within their pools, thus allowing for instant, peer-to-peer transactions without direct counterparties. This innovative approach not only can improve the trading experience but it also democratizes market making, making it so anyone can provide liquidity and collect yield. Since AMMs utilize mathematical formulas they can be spun up on any asset at any scale allowing them to service most tokens in DeFi.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"how-do-amms-work\"\u003eHow do AMMs work?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo provide liquidity in an AMM, a user deposits a pair of tokens into a liquidity pool, typically in equal value, and in return, receives liquidity tokens representing their share of the pool. This enables the AMM to offer trades between the deposited assets, with prices determined by a formula based on the pool's supply and demand. The pool charges fees which are distributed to the liquidity providers in terms of yield. The more volume through the pool and the higher the fee charged the more liquidity providers get paid. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAMMs are not risk free yield. As the prices of assets within a pool diverge due to market fluctuations, the AMM will rebalance the pool to maintain the predetermined ratio of assets. Rebalancing can be done dynamically by the pool or through arbitrageurs. This rebalancing act leads to what's known as impermanent loss for liquidity providers. It occurs because the value of their deposited assets changes in relation to one another; specifically, they end up holding more of the depreciated asset and less of the appreciated one due to rebalancing. This divergence from the original value can result in a loss relative to the potential gains had the assets been held outside the pool. The further prices diverge from the prices at which assets were deposited into the pool the more impermanent loss a liquidity provider will experience. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://jito-labs.ghost.io/content/images/2024/05/3-Impermanent-loss-explained.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1146\" srcset=\"https://jito-labs.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/3-Impermanent-loss-explained.png 600w, https://jito-labs.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/3-Impermanent-loss-explained.png 1000w, https://jito-labs.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2024/05/3-Impermanent-loss-explained.png 1600w, https://jito-labs.ghost.io/content/images/size/w2400/2024/05/3-Impermanent-loss-explained.png 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the realm of DeFi, selecting pairs with stable assets is essential for liquidity providers (LPs) to minimize impermanent loss. For example, consider an LP contributing to a SOL/USDC pool when 1 SOL equals 100 USDC, depositing 1 SOL and 100 USDC. If the price of SOL doubles to 200 USDC, the AMM's mechanism adjusts the pool to maintain balance, resulting in the LP owning a mix that equates to less value than simply holding 1 SOL and 100 USDC outside the pool. The difference is impermanent loss.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"clmms\"\u003eCLMMs\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eConcentrated Liquidity Market Makers (CLMMs) are an evolution of the traditional AMM model, allowing liquidity providers to allocate their capital to specific price ranges within a liquidity pool, rather than dispersing it across the entire price curve. This mechanism concentrates liquidity where it's most needed, enhancing capital efficiency and potentially offering higher yields for provided liquidity within those ranges. Unlike AMMs, where assets are uniformly distributed, CLMMs enable providers to select ranges to target liquidity, improving capital efficiency by allowing providers to provide more depth with less capital within the range. This can allow for higher fee generation if the price of the asset stays within the selected range. However, this approach also introduces the risk of becoming temporarily inactive if the market price moves outside the selected range, potentially reducing earnings. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://jito-labs.ghost.io/content/images/2024/05/4-CLMMs---Option-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1146\" srcset=\"https://jito-labs.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/4-CLMMs---Option-1.png 600w, https://jito-labs.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/4-CLMMs---Option-1.png 1000w, https://jito-labs.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2024/05/4-CLMMs---Option-1.png 1600w, https://jito-labs.ghost.io/content/images/2024/05/4-CLMMs---Option-1.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eConcentrated Liquidity Market Makers (CLMMs) offer a nuanced approach to limit impermanent loss through the strategic allocation of capital within predetermined price intervals. Since CLMMs concentrate liquidity provision within certain intervals CLMMs limit the exposure of LPs' capital to broader market price movements outside their chosen intervals. Within the chosen interval impermanent loss is higher given the concentration of liquidity. If the asset price moves beyond these ranges, the capital is no longer at risk of impermanent loss associated with those out-of-range movements because it's not actively providing liquidity in those price levels. This focused participation inherently reduces the likelihood of substantial impermanent loss, as the assets are less exposed to volatile price swings, making CLMMs an effective tool for LPs looking to mitigate this risk while still capitalizing on their market insights.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"considerations\"\u003eConsiderations\u0026nbsp;\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo maximize profits, liquidity providers (LPs) try to strategically select pools that combine high trading volumes, high fees and stable asset pairings to maximize yield while avoiding impermanent loss. This section will explore considerations liquidity providers can implement to avoid impermanent loss.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"liquidity-mining\"\u003eLiquidity Mining\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eLiquidity mining is the process of protocols emitting tokens to encourage, or “mine”, users to use their protocol or provide liquidity. In the context of liquidity provision, liquidity mining is done to either encourage liquidity for a protocol's native token or by a platform to attract liquidity providers to use it. These rewards, often in the form of the platform's native tokens, serve as an incentive to attract and retain liquidity providers, effectively increasing the pool's capital and trading volume. This strategy not only compensates for the inherent risks associated with AMMs, such as impermanent loss, but can also significantly augment the total yield for liquidity providers.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"hedging\"\u003eHedging\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo counteract impermanent loss exposure in DeFi, liquidity providers (LPs) can employ derivatives as a strategic hedge. Continuing with the SOL/USDC pool example, suppose an LP deposits 1 SOL (valued at 100 USDC) and 100 USDC. To hedge against potential impermanent loss, the LP could take a long position in a SOL derivative contract equivalent to the deposited SOL value. If SOL's price then escalates to 200 USDC, the LP's gain on the long position would more than offset the impermanent loss experienced within the AMM pool. This derivative strategy effectively provides a financial cushion, allowing the LP to maintain the overall value of their investment despite fluctuations in SOL's price.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe hedging example provided the derivatives are used to mitigate impermanent loss in a scenario where SOL's price increases. While this strategy offers protection against losses due to an increase in the SOL price, comprehensive hedging strategies can also be crafted to protect against both upward and downward movements with strategies like straddles or strangles. Hedging strategies only make sense when the total yield (or return) from participating in the liquidity pool outweighs the costs associated with the hedging positions. This includes both options premiums and funding rates. If the cost of the hedge significantly erodes the potential earnings from the liquidity pool, the strategy may not be financially viable.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"diversification\"\u003eDiversification\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eLiquidity Providers (LPs) can utilize multi-pool strategies to limit impermanent loss by diversifying their investments across multiple liquidity pools, each with varying asset pairs and risk profiles. This approach spreads the potential risk of impermanent loss across different markets and conditions, reducing the impact of significant price movements in any single asset. For example a LP might allocate capital to pools containing uncorrelated assets like $MOBILE/USDC and $JUP/USDC to reduce exposure to significant price changes in any one asset. By strategically selecting pools with assets that have non-correlated or inversely correlated price movements, LPs can reduce the likelihood that a significant price movement in one asset will adversely affect their entire portfolio. This multifaceted approach allows LPs to tailor their risk exposure and optimize their potential returns, leveraging the dynamics of different pools to balance out impermanent loss against profit opportunities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"delta-neutral\"\u003eDelta Neutral\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eLiquidity Providers (LPs) can craft a delta-neutral yield position by deploying capital into liquidity pools containing correlated assets. This strategy involves selecting asset pairs that move in tandem or have a strong correlation, such as different liquid staking token pools like $LST/$SOL. By providing liquidity to a pool of correlated assets, an LP can essentially offset the price movement of one asset with the other, maintaining a balanced position irrespective of market fluctuations. This delta-neutral position mitigates the potential for impermanent loss since the relative value of the assets remains more constant, allowing LPs to capitalize on the yield generated from trading fees while maintaining full exposure to assets in the pool.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"tools-and-protocols\"\u003eTools and Protocols\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe DeFi landscape is continuously evolving, introducing innovative tools and platforms designed to enhance the liquidity provision experience. Among these advancements, automated strategies and rebalancing tools stand out, offering liquidity providers (LPs) sophisticated mechanisms to manage and optimize their positions with minimal manual intervention.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"auto-rebalancing-pools\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAuto Rebalancing Pools\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eAuto rebalancing pools present a novel approach in decentralized finance (DeFi) that addresses some key limitations of traditional Automated Market Makers (AMMs). By automatically adjusting their parameters to maintain tighter price spreads around the market value, these pools significantly reduce the risk of impermanent loss for liquidity providers (LPs) by minimizing the price divergence of assets within the pool. This innovative mechanism lessens the pool's dependence on arbitrageurs for price correction, thereby preserving more liquidity within the pool and preventing value extraction by arbitrage profits. Furthermore, auto rebalancing pools deploy dynamic fee structures and reward mechanisms that align more closely with current market conditions, offering LPs potentially better compensation for their provided liquidity compared to the static fees of traditional pools. The entire rebalancing process is managed through smart contracts, eliminating the need for manual intervention by LPs and reducing the risk of losses due to delayed reactions to market movements. This automated management ensures a more efficient and time-saving operation, contributing to the overall effectiveness and appeal of auto rebalancing pools in the DeFi ecosystem.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"drifting-clmms\"\u003eDrifting CLMMs\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eProtocols like Kamino offer auto rebalancing CLMM where the ranges drift over time. The benefit of drifting CLMMs is that you maintain the capital efficiency benefits of a CLMM while minimizing time in which capital isn’t active by moving the range to adjust to price. Ranges can be adjusted a number of different ways, one of the ways is setting them based on a drifting strategy.\u0026nbsp; Usually ranges are set based on a moving average but there are multiple different ways to set ranges depending on goals of LPs. The idea of using a moving average to set range is that most of the time the price will be in range keeping the liquidity pool active, but if there is a sharp price change in either direction the pool will become as price moves outside of the range helping protect liquidity providers against impairment loss. Drifting CLMMs are a good way to passively maximize capital efficiency while protecting against impermanent loss.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"other-adjacent-products\"\u003eOther adjacent products\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition to traditional liquidity provision on AMMs, sophisticated methods like the Jupiter Liquidity Provider Pool (JLP), Drift Market Making Vault, and Drift Insurance Fund offer alternative avenues for liquidity providers to earn yield. The JLP allows users to deposit assets to receive non-rebasing JLP tokens, sharing in 70% of trading fees as yield. This allows users to passively provide liquidity and get exposure to jupiter. The Drift Market Making Vault employs a delta-neutral strategy in perpetual swaps, rewarding users with a portion of the profits generated, despite facing volatility and counterparty risks. Lastly, the Drift Insurance Fund offers stakers hourly rewards from a Revenue Pool funded by fees from various protocol activities, with a unique mechanism to handle levered losses and AMM deficits. Each option presents a different risk-reward profile and mechanism for yield generation, catering to users with varying risk appetites and liquidity provision strategies. Each of these have their own benefits and unique risk but tools like these are valuable in building your ideal portfolio.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eDisclaimer: None of the content in this article should be construed as financial advise.

Ethereum, inspired by Bitcoin’s functionality, or lack thereof, was the first blockchain to come equipped with a Turing-complete programming language enabling smart contracts to communicate with one another, while Solana, inspired by the lack of a synchronized global state, was the first blockchain to be built around parallelization, optimized for performance and scalability.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEthereum has and continues to dominate TVL across DeFi, though a significant chunk of this is to be attributed to the success of early DeFi protocols such as Aave and Uniswap, which introduced new primitives to the crypto-economy such as borrowing and lending and the use of liquidity pools to facilitate price discovery. Due to the success of these protocols, though, there have been many different forks and projects replicating others in hopes of siphoning their liquidity away, which has led to over 1,000 protocols on Ethereum today though with just a fraction of the daily active addresses per protocol relative to Solana.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSolana has been on a strong recovery ever since bottoming near the collapse of FTX, with strong growth present at the network and application layer. Though Solana still holds a fraction of the total TVL of Ethereum today, it has matched up to and even outperformed the activity on Ethereum and L2s at times. Furthermore, with more daily active addresses per protocol on average, it can be argued that Solana has a more engaged and organic user base, demonstrating that, more often than not, quality outweighs quantity. \u003c/p\u003e","comment_id":"662955fc17113b0001ce0766","feature_image":"https://jito-labs.ghost.io/content/images/2024/04/Solana-DeFi---Solana-vs-ETH-DeFi_Option-2.png","featured":false,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2024-04-24T18:57:00.000+00:00","updated_at":"2024-05-03T14:16:39.000+00:00","published_at":"2024-05-02T18:47:21.000+00:00","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"tags":[{"id":"64add3d75737da000171032d","name":"#jito-foundation-posts","slug":"hash-jito-foundation-posts","description":"Tag for posts to go to Jito Foundation blog","feature_image":null,"visibility":"internal","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"https://jito-labs.ghost.io/404/"},{"id":"65eb6a73be761300015de79c","name":"#educational","slug":"hash-educational","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"internal","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"https://jito-labs.ghost.io/404/"},{"id":"64af1b8e386b3200014a66e5","name":"Solana Network","slug":"solana-network","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"https://jito-labs.ghost.io/tag/solana-network/"}],"primary_tag":null,"url":"https://jito-labs.ghost.io/solana-vs-eth/","excerpt":"Introduction\n\nDecentralized finance (DeFi) protocols are blockchain-native applications that enable anyone with a self-custodial wallet to access various financial services through digital assets, including trading, staking, borrowing, and lending in a permissionless environment.

Traders on decentralized exchanges are routinely “sandwiched,” a type of MEV that takes advantage of lax slippage settings to shave valuable basis points from traders' portfolios. Generalized frontrunning MEV bots, meanwhile, are so sophisticated that they can even get ahead of hacks — robbing funds from the robbers, and only occasionally returning the proceeds.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, the Jito Network is helping to build an alternative future for MEV on Solana.

The first order drives the price up or down, benefiting the second order. This is common in decentralized exchanges where transactions are visible before they are finalized.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eNFT Minting: During NFT minting events, participants aim to secure rare or valuable NFTs by being the first to mint. This opportunity arises suddenly, typically at the block when the mint goes live. The congestion during such events can significantly spike, leading to network slowdowns or halts, with gas costs on blockchains like Ethereum spiking significantly.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLiquidations: This involves monitoring the blockchain for undercollateralized loan positions which, when found, can be liquidated by repaying part or all of the debt and receiving collateral as a reward. These opportunities help maintain protocol solvency and are found in systems that use both tokens and NFTs as collateral.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eArbitrage: Arbitrageurs capitalize on price differences of the same asset across different exchanges or platforms. This includes intra-chain (within the same blockchain), inter-chain (across different blockchains), and between centralized (CEX) and decentralized exchanges (DEX). Intra-chain arbitrage is notable for its atomicity—ensuring both transactions occur within the same blockchain environment.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eNotably, at least two of these types of MEV create negative externalities for the average blockchain user. Sandwiching is explicitly predatory, and largely relies on users or DEX interfaces having set overly-broad slippage settings in order to work. Frontrunning NFT mints, meanwhile, allows a single entity to capture a large portion of a collection, reducing access for casual buyers and potentially imbalancing market dynamics.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, it could be argued that arbitrage and liquidations increase the health of a network. Arbitrage ensures efficient markets and fair trades across CEX/DEX venues. Meanwhile, liquidations do negatively affect the particular user getting liquidated (though to be clear, unless the liquidation is the result of an exploit, the blame lies with the user and not the liquidator), but timely and orderly liquidations also protect the health of the DeFi protocol and wider ecosystem involved.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTherefore, “good” MEV can be thought of as activity that promotes the health of the network and users on which it operates, whereas “bad” MEV tends to exploit or disadvantage the average user, who either falls prey to or is incapable of taking advantage of MEV opportunities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith this foundation, we can begin to examine how the Jito Network approaches encouraging good MEV.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"the-jito-network\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Jito Network\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to supporting good MEV, the Jito Network boasts two key components: the Jito-Solana validator client, and JitoSOL, a liquid staking token.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Jito-Solana validator client operates an auction mechanism for blockspace for portions of each Solana block, where Jito assures the inclusion of certain transaction sets known as “bundles.” MEV “searchers” submit these bundles, which are assured on-chain execution upon winning a “tip” auction. These tips, crucially, are separate from the priority fees within the Solana protocol.

Originally coined in the heat of DeFi Summer and the 2020-2021 crypto bull run, “yield farming” has become an umbrella term for blockchain-native financial strategies that seek to capture profits from various protocol and network incentives.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt its core, yield farming simply involves depositing an asset into a smart contract programmed to accrue monetary rewards through real yield, i.e. trading fees, and/or inflationary token emissions.\u0026nbsp; The origins of yield farming can be traced back to Synthetix and Compound Finance, which began distributing their native governance tokens to incentivize liquidity and users to their borrowing protocols. The frenzy picked up and more teams began to follow suit, implementing various incentive distribution mechanisms in order to grow their protocols. Today, yield farming is a cornerstone of DeFi, existing across many different blockchains and applications, including our home, Solana.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"yield-farming-on-solanaamms\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYield Farming on Solana - AMMs\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe most common form of yield farming is liquidity provision on automated market maker (AMM) protocols. Pioneered by Uniswap in 2018, AMMs utilize a simple two-party system of \u003cstrong\u003eswappers \u003c/strong\u003eand \u003cstrong\u003eliquidity providers (LPs), \u003c/strong\u003ewhich work together to facilitate decentralized trading. LPs earn yield from trading fees and inflationary token emissions - though it is worth noting that this is far from a risk-free endeavor. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLiquidity pools are smart contracts programmed to maintain a 50/50 balance of two assets in a trading pair at all times, i.e., SOL-USDC, which is enforced by automatically rebalancing liquidity when the asset ratio diverges. For instance, assuming 1 SOL = $100, the asset balance in a SOL - USDC liquidity pool may consist of 1 SOL and 100 USDC, worth $200 total. Say the price of 1 SOL jumps to $150 - the new balance would now have to be adjusted accordingly: 1 SOL at $150 + 50 USDC.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eProviding liquidity on AMMs is a common yield farming strategy and a relatively simple concept to understand, but it is important to note that it is not risk-free and should not be treated as such.

Entities must lock up native SOL tokens in order to be eligible to participate in the economic security of the network and earn more SOL for doing so. However, the role of staking services on Solana has continued to evolve and expand in ways that further benefit stakers and the broader Solana ecosystem. Let’s further unpack the evolution of staking on Solana and how stakers’ returns have grown as a result.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"staking-on-solana\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStaking on Solana\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs mentioned, entities must stake SOL tokens to validators, which validate transactions and produce blocks, in order to earn native staking rewards on Solana. Though anyone with SOL can stake to any validator directly, this can become difficult to maintain if one wishes to spread their stake across more validators to earn a higher yield. Since validators aim to maintain profitable operations to continue staking over time, incentivizing a broader stake is becoming increasingly vital.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is where staking pools help - staking pools allow for many different entities to collectively pool their SOL into a shared smart contract, with a fixed APY percentage that comes from the redistribution of validator block rewards. Staking pools are also advantageous because they distribute stake across various validators. Essentially, they allow stakers to outsource the process of finding the best validator to delegate stake to.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, traditionally, staking would involve locking up tokens in a smart contract to be withdrawn at a pre-specified date and a fixed rate of return, rendering them illiquid and obsolete for the duration they are staked.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat if there was a way to access the staked SOL liquidity for further usage in the ecosystem?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"liquid-staking-on-solana\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLiquid Staking on Solana\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLiquid staking represents the evolution of staking services and their role within the broader crypto ecosystem.

However, it is important to note that priority fees do not guarantee earlier inclusion for a transaction. This is because Solana does not have a native mempool like Ethereum, and there isn’t a native mechanism (yet) for a dynamic base fee to price blockspace accurately. Therefore, remember that while using priority fees is likely to get your transaction through faster, it is not guaranteed.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"step-4-staking-on-solana\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStep 4: Staking on Solana\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith your new freshly funded wallet, you may find yourself wondering how to get the most of your idle SOL tokens.

Entities must lock up native SOL tokens in order to be eligible to participate in the economic security of the network and earn more SOL for doing so. However, the role of staking services on Solana has continued to evolve and expand in ways that further benefit stakers and the broader Solana ecosystem. Let’s further unpack the evolution of staking on Solana and how stakers’ returns have grown as a result.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"staking-on-solana\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStaking on Solana\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs mentioned, entities must stake SOL tokens to validators, which validate transactions and produce blocks, in order to earn native staking rewards on Solana. Though anyone with SOL can stake to any validator directly, this can become difficult to maintain if one wishes to spread their stake across more validators to earn a higher yield. Since validators aim to maintain profitable operations to continue staking over time, incentivizing a broader stake is becoming increasingly vital.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is where staking pools help - staking pools allow for many different entities to collectively pool their SOL into a shared smart contract, with a fixed APY percentage that comes from the redistribution of validator block rewards. Staking pools are also advantageous because they distribute stake across various validators. Essentially, they allow stakers to outsource the process of finding the best validator to delegate stake to.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, traditionally, staking would involve locking up tokens in a smart contract to be withdrawn at a pre-specified date and a fixed rate of return, rendering them illiquid and obsolete for the duration they are staked.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat if there was a way to access the staked SOL liquidity for further usage in the ecosystem?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"liquid-staking-on-solana\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLiquid Staking on Solana\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLiquid staking represents the evolution of staking services and their role within the broader crypto ecosystem.

This central point of control carries inherent risks, as it holds the power to move any amount of stake to a single validator — a power that could be exploited if the wallet were ever compromised. Recognizing this vulnerability, StakeNet introduces an innovative shift: the transition of hot wallet authority to an on-chain steward program. The hot wallet authority, called the \"Staker\" in spl-stake-pool terminology, is moved to a PDA (Program Derived Address) owned by the Steward. This means that the only stake movement operations that can occur are those computed with the on-chain inputs and scoring algorithm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis transition not only enhances security by making it impossible for malicious actors to control the wallet through external means but also automates the process. The Steward Program operates as an intelligent state machine, designed to reward validators that perform well and penalize those that don't, aligning incentives with the health of the network.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://jito-labs.ghost.io/content/images/2023/11/eJMExP4hrJpGRCeQf1hTuIROvU7cYlKYIHUERJtkbUdsY2WBXrM3zJq-WPk9y7l1z28h3azrvpB77b3hCwF-l_GtH5MKtDznu82hpDJvlY7V79rnBTLMSMhw3wnCPWKzATrfOHd6tES35cTx3QeFzTg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1142\" height=\"668\" srcset=\"https://jito-labs.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/11/eJMExP4hrJpGRCeQf1hTuIROvU7cYlKYIHUERJtkbUdsY2WBXrM3zJq-WPk9y7l1z28h3azrvpB77b3hCwF-l_GtH5MKtDznu82hpDJvlY7V79rnBTLMSMhw3wnCPWKzATrfOHd6tES35cTx3QeFzTg.png 600w, https://jito-labs.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/11/eJMExP4hrJpGRCeQf1hTuIROvU7cYlKYIHUERJtkbUdsY2WBXrM3zJq-WPk9y7l1z28h3azrvpB77b3hCwF-l_GtH5MKtDznu82hpDJvlY7V79rnBTLMSMhw3wnCPWKzATrfOHd6tES35cTx3QeFzTg.png 1000w, https://jito-labs.ghost.io/content/images/2023/11/eJMExP4hrJpGRCeQf1hTuIROvU7cYlKYIHUERJtkbUdsY2WBXrM3zJq-WPk9y7l1z28h3azrvpB77b3hCwF-l_GtH5MKtDznu82hpDJvlY7V79rnBTLMSMhw3wnCPWKzATrfOHd6tES35cTx3QeFzTg.png 1142w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cem class=\"italic\" style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003eOn-chain stake movement\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"stakenet-as-a-platform\"\u003eStakeNet As A Platform\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe primary immediate objective is to establish JitoSOL as the pioneering stake pool that uses StakeNet for its operations in a permissionless way.
