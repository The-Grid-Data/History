[Introduction  Solana, which we call home, is a high-performance Layer 1
blockchain that uses Proof-of-Stake (PoS) to determine who gets to validate
incoming transactions and produce new blocks. Entities must lock up native SOL
tokens in order to be eligible to participate in the economic security of the
network and earn more SOL for doing so. However, the role of staking services
on Solana has continued to evolve and expand in ways that further benefit
stakers and the broader Solana ecosystem](/blog/lsts-vs-native-assets/)
