[Nihar Shah](https://jumpcrypto.com/contributor/nihar/)Suraj Srinivasan[Lucas
Baker](https://jumpcrypto.com/contributor/lucas/)Alex Toberoff

This short note illustrates the theoretical solution to a trader determining
how to optimally swap her wealth into a target asset through on-chain
operations. It offers the framework to solve optimal slippage parameters and
optimal trade size.

#### [Invariance Properties of Maximal Extractable
Value](/research/invariance-properties-of-maximal-extractable-value/)

Alan Guo

We develop a formalism for reasoning about trading on decentralized exchanges
on blockchains and a formulation of a particular form of maximal extractable
value (MEV) that represents the total arbitrage opportunity extractable from
on-chain liquidity.

Number-Theoretic-Transform (NTT) is a variation of Fast-Fourier-Transform
(FFT) on finite fields and is increasingly being used in blockchain and zero-
knowledge proof applications. In this paper, we explain how CycloneNTT fits
into this equation and the problem it solves.

Multi-Scalar Multiplication (MSM) on elliptic curves is one of the primitives
and bottlenecks at the core of many zero-knowledge proof systems. Speeding up
MSM typically results in faster proof generation, which in turn makes ZK-based
applications practical.

#### [Strategic Peer Selection Using Transaction Value and
Latency](/research/strategic-peer-selection-using-transaction-value-and-

[Lucas Baker](https://jumpcrypto.com/contributor/lucas/)Kushal Babel

In this paper, we study how existing definitions and algorithms for latency
optimization can be augmented with information about about the transactions
themselves in order to optimize peering algorithms.

[Nihar Shah](https://jumpcrypto.com/contributor/nihar/)Christian
CataliniAlonso de Gortari

Stablecoins have the potential to drastically increase competition and
innovation in financial services by reducing our reliance on traditional
intermediaries. But they also introduce new challenges, which we navigate
through in this paper.

#### [Strategic Liquidity Provision in Uniswap v3](/research/strategic-
liquidity-provision-in-uniswap-v3/)

Michael NeuderDaniel J. MorozRithvik RaoDavid C. Parkes

We formalize the problem of strategic liquidity provision and study three
classes of strategies for liquidity providers: uniform, proportional, and
optimal (via a constrained optimization problem).

Michael NeuderDaniel J. MorozRithvik RaoDavid C. Parkes

We outline two dishonest strategies that can be cheaply executed on the
Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain, even by validators holding less than one-third of
the total stake: malicious chain reorganizations ('reorgs') and finality
delays.

#### [Setting Stablecoin Standards](/research/setting-stablecoin-standards/)

[Nihar Shah](https://jumpcrypto.com/contributor/nihar/)Christian Catalini

US regulators have suggested that only FDIC-insured financial institutions be
allowed to issue stablecoins. We propose an alternative path, which provides
similar guarantees in terms of financial resilience.

#### [Defending Against Malicious Reorgs in Tezos Proof-of-
Stake](/research/defending-against-malicious-reorgs-in-tezos-proof-of-stake/)

Michael NeuderDaniel J. MorozRithvik RaoDavid C. Parkes

Blockchains are intended to be immutable, so an attacker who is able to delete
transactions through a chain reorganization (a malicious reorg) can perform a
profitable double-spend attack. We study the rate at which this can happen.

Protocol](/research/selfish-behavior-in-the-tezos-proof-of-stake-protocol/)

Michael NeuderDaniel J. MorozRithvik RaoDavid C. Parkes

Proof-of-Stake consensus protocols give rise to complex modeling challenges.
We analyze the recently-updated Tezos Proof-of-Stake protocol and demonstrate
that how sometimes rational participants are incentivized to behave
dishonestly.

#### [Doubly Heterogeneous Monetary Spillovers](/research/doubly-

[Nihar Shah](https://jumpcrypto.com/contributor/nihar/)

Monetary spillovers are heterogeneous in two ways: how central banks generate
them and how countries receive them. First, the Fed is mostly unique in its
ability to affect other countries' financial markets, among ten developed
central banks.

Consider a coordination game played on a network, where agents prefer taking
actions closer to those of their neighbors and to their own ideal points in
action space. We explore what welfare outcomes depend on and what it all
means.

#### [Machine Learning for Compliance-Weighted Wald
Estimators](/research/machine-learning-for-compliance-weighted-wald-

[Nihar Shah](https://jumpcrypto.com/contributor/nihar/)Dominic Coey

In experiments with noncompliance, some subjects assigned to the treatment
group may be unlikely to actually receive treatment, presenting difficulties
for obtaining precise estimates of treatment effects. In this study, we seek
to address the issue by introducing a class of compliance-weighted Wald
estimators in which those unlikely to be compliers are downweighted and
observe the effects.
