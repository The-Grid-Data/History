![Bridging and Finality: Ethereum](https://jumpcrypto-
com.ghost.io/content/images/2023/03/Blog---Bridging---Finality_-ETH-Blog--
1-.png)

Post-merge, Ethereum’s consensus protocol involves the composition of two
heterogeneous protocols, and as such, there is a wide design space for
developers to consider when building cross-chain. As we laid out in our [first
post](https://jumpcrypto.com/bridging-and-finality-an-
introduction/?ref=jumpcrypto.com) in this series, the core tradeoff cross-
chain applications must design for is the one between _reversion risk_ and
_latency_. For each stage we delineate below, we’ll try to give a meaningful
picture of where it lies along this tradeoff by providing some empirical
observations, characterizing the attack surface and offering some references
for further reading.

![](https://jumpcrypto-com.ghost.io/content/images/2023/03/ZK-
Bridging-1.png)_A toy illustration: different chains offer different tradeoff
curves along reversion risk and latency_

## Preliminaries

Ethereum’s consensus model, as well as the [history of its
development](https://github.com/ethereum/pos-evolution/blob/master/pos-
evolution.md?ref=jumpcrypto.com), is well documented, so for this post we’ll
assume working knowledge of the main concepts—if you’re not yet familiar, the
work of a thorough explanation is best left to the [Gasper
paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.03052.pdf?ref=jumpcrypto.com). Although
we’ll give brief recaps of the core components of Ethereum’s consensus, this
post is intended to act as a field guide for cross-chain development, giving
quick references for the distributions across latency and the reversion rate
we can expect at a given stage in the protocol.

At a very high level, Ethereum’s consensus is based off a set of staked
validators who produce blocks while attesting to and determining their view of
the canonical chain through two separate mechanisms. The first mechanism, a
fork choice rule called LMD GHOST, provides a way for full nodes to resolve
the ambiguous tree of blocks that arise from asynchronous block production and
voting, allowing validators to determine which chain to propose new blocks on
top of. At checkpoints in the block production schedule, Casper FFG, a BFT
mechanism that acts on a longer time scale, initiates a round of voting
amongst the entire validator set that requires a hard threshold of 2/3rds to
pass—once Casper consensus is achieved, the tree is “pruned” down to a single
canonical chain up to the checkpoint, while the tree continues to progress.

An important note to reiterate is that we’re going to be discussing consensus
from the perspective of full nodes here: as we discussed in our previous post,
finality and block safety guarantees (more generally) are meaningful only in
reference to a given view of the chain. When a qualifier isn’t given, the
implicit assumption is usually that we’re taking the viewpoint of a full node,
but we want to be explicit about this here, since not all bridge designs
conform to this assumption. The “lifecycle” we will describe is specific to
the view of full nodes, and this is an important distinction because not all
of these stages will be visible to light clients or carry the same security
assumptions.

## Block Proposal

![](https://jumpcrypto-com.ghost.io/content/images/2023/03/ZK-Bridging-2--
1-.png)

### Rundown

A block proposal is the first time a transaction will be visible (from the
perspective of consensus) to the full nodes observing the network and provides
the first meaningful indication of eventual inclusion in the finalized chain.
Confirmation that is close to immediate is clearly an attractive property for
bridge transactions to have; however, this comes with an extremely low
security threshold and thus is only appropriate to use for applications where
reversions are inconsequential to UX or safety.

### Latency

Under ideal conditions a proposal will come out every slot, which is every 12
seconds [Note that this is when we expect proposals to be produced—network
delay is another factor that will determine when a given node will actually
****see**** a proposal]. However, while the slot schedule is constant, this
doesn’t guarantee that we’ll actually see a new block, as it’s possible that a
proposer for a given slot doesn’t actually release one.

Under adversarial conditions, in order to delay block production for N
consecutive slots, an attacker would have to compromise the proposers for each
of those slots. If we consider a model where an attacker can only accomplish
this by directly owning the proposer for a slot, the odds of this as a
function of the attacker’s stake follow a binomial distribution, which drops
off exponentially as N increases. However, other cases to consider are ones in
which an attacker tries to bribe or DDOS third-party proposers, which are more
difficult to cleanly describe or make assumptions about, so there isn’t a
clear model we can use to determine an upper bound on these probabilities.

Another factor to consider here is proposal failures from honest
validators—while causes like individual network failures or poor node
management are likely to be one-off cases, correlated strings of block
proposal failures can occur if there’s a bug in a client implementation used
by a large proportion of validators. This has turned out to be a more relevant
consideration so far, as we’ve actually seen such cases happen with the beacon
chain as described [here](https://barnabe.substack.com/p/a-data-driven-view-
of-the-beacon?ref=jumpcrypto.com), although it should be noted that these
occurrences were pre-merge and [client
diversity](https://clientdiversity.org/?ref=jumpcrypto.com#distribution) has
improved since then, decreasing the chances of these kinds of correlated
failures.

Here’s a short description of the observed distribution of slot delays between
proposed blocks since the Merge occurred:

![](https://jumpcrypto-com.ghost.io/content/images/2023/03/ETH-Table--
1-.png)_Results from our archived full node history since the merge._

### Reversion Risks

Since the block proposal step happens before any validator attestations can
occur, at this point we can’t even be sure if the most recent block proposed
will end up in the chain selected by GHOST (or even start out as the canonical
head), much less in the finalized chain, so we face reversion risks under the
fork-choice rule, which we’ll discuss in the next section. The risk we face
related specifically to this stage is a double proposal from a malicious
proposer. The odds that an attacker with X% of stake controls the proposer for
a given slot are of course just X% (however, it’s probably better to consider
the proportion of validators who will make the locally rational decision to
accept a bribe to do so).

In practice, there have been less than a dozen proposer equivocations on the
beacon chain, and all of these occurred before it actually went live with the
merge
([here](https://beaconscan.com/slot/3339591?ref=jumpcrypto.com#proposerslashing)
is the last one to occur as of the date of publication). Although this rate is
extremely low, it’s important to keep in mind that the cost for an attacker to
double propose is of course capped at 32 ETH, the stake of a single validator
(and it will be much lower if it’s an isolated event).

Although the observed rate is low, it makes for a very weak security
assumption—transactions should only be confirmed upon block proposal if they
would cause ********no harm******** to a protocol or its users if they’re
reverted. Use cases that might be able to safely use block proposals to
confirm bridged transactions are services that don’t carry significant value
either directly or implicitly, such as cross-chain emails. More generally, if
the state you attest to with a bridge transaction is guaranteed by contract-
level to be immutable (though you should be extremely cautious about
confirming this assumption), then you won’t incur any harm if your attestation
gets reverted, since the state it’s attesting to will still be valid.

### Inclusion in GHOST chain

![](https://jumpcrypto-com.ghost.io/content/images/2023/03/ZK-Bridging-3--
1-.png)

### Rundown

By inclusion in the chain, we specifically mean inclusion in the fork chosen
by applying the LMD GHOST algorithm (this is a pre-requisite to achieving
finality under Casper). Note that a block that has just been proposed will not
necessarily be the head of the chain under this fork choice rule, so this is a
stronger condition than block proposal, and even if it does start out there,
it can be reverted later as block production and consensus progress.

Although a fork being selected by GHOST doesn’t guarantee it can’t be reverted
(it’s just a rule applied to our local view of the chain), as the subtree
rooted in our block of interest accumulates attestation weight, we can
increase our confidence that it will eventually be finalized down the line,
roughly analogously to how we count the number of block confirmations in
Nakamoto protocols, which we explored in our [last
post](https://jumpcrypto.com/bridging-and-finality-an-
introduction/?ref=jumpcrypto.com).

Similarly also to our discussion within the post, there isn’t a point in this
process where we gain absolute certainty that a block won’t be reverted (in
fact, rather than leaving it up to a subjective heuristic, Ethereum instead
defers the determination of “finality” to Casper), so we can consider the
latency/reversion tradeoff in this stage as falling along a gradient according
to a block’s subtree weight.

### Latency

Once again, since there aren’t any specific points in the progression of the
chain under the fork choice that provide qualitatively new guarantees, there
aren’t particularly meaningful conditions to measure latency against. If we’re
interested in the expected time until a given proportion of attestation weight
is reached for a given subtree, it’s best to have a rough understanding of the
rate at which it can be accumulated. Validators vote according to the
scheduled slot of their committees, which are split evenly among the 32 slots
in the epoch, so it will take a minimum of a slot (12 seconds) for a subtree
to gain 1/32 of the total vote-weight of the validator set. This will progress
at a constant rate (subject to the participation rate of each slot’s
committee) if a competing fork doesn’t appear.

### Reversion Risks

Generally, the way an attacker can cause a reversion under LMD GHOST is by
controlling a proposer for a slot, but withholding their proposal, then later
revealing a fork that reverts some honest blocks and throwing their
attestation weight onto it. If we consider just the naive attack, then if a
given subtree has already accumulated N attestations, an attacker will have to
have that same attestation weight in order to fork the network away from it.

However, there are adversarial strategies that improve on this—the high-level
takeaway from formulations like the [Avalanche
attack](https://ethresear.ch/t/avalanche-attack-on-proof-of-stake-
ghost/11854?ref=jumpcrypto.com) is that attackers can achieve deeper
reversions with their stakeweight through the timing of their reveals and the
structure of the alternate forks they produce. Thus, although the difficulty
of reverting a block clearly increases along with its subtree attestation
weight, it’s difficult to put an exact price on this.

A number of modifications have been made to Ethereum’s fork choice rule that
make these attacks less feasible, such as [ignoring validators who
equivocate](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-
specs/pull/2845?ref=jumpcrypto.com) with their attestations and [proposer
boost](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-
specs/pull/2730?ref=jumpcrypto.com), which gives extra weight to blocks
proposed in a timely manner, but the exact parameters required for a
successful attack remain fairly vague.

Although block reversions can also occur among honest validators due to
network asynchrony or client partitions
([here](https://barnabe.substack.com/p/pos-ethereum-reorg?ref=jumpcrypto.com)
is an exploration of a 7-block reorg that occurred pre-merge, due to a
partially adopted consensus client update), Ethereum’s PoS consensus is very
effective at preventing conditions that produce “accidental” re-orgs, having
so far proven to be much more stable than under the proof of work regime.

Our own full nodes have experienced about 90 chain re-orgs since the merge,
with _****none****_ of them reverting deeper than a single block. Once again,
it’s important not to take this as a prior thoughtlessly and assume that
deeper reversions can’t happen, especially if there are specific payoffs to an
attacker for doing so. Even with 51% of the total attestation weight of
validators, which would prevent any naive attacks, there still isn’t a formal
guarantee that a subtree can’t be reverted—for cross-chain applications, the
risk of double spend attacks (which are accomplished by causing reversions)
are particularly crucial to consider.

Another important consideration here is that bridge transactions can contain
unique forms of MEV and thus could provide an extra incentive for attackers to
try to re-org the chain. Hence, cross-chain application designers must
consider not only the risk of block reversions under GHOST in the general
case, but also the potential that the transactions their protocol produces
might present (in of themselves) an incentive for attackers to target their
blocks, even if they can’t profit directly through a double spend.

Although this is somewhat of a second-order effect, it’s important to consider
since it means that pre-finality confirmations are dangerous not only for
cross-chain transactions that directly transfer value (which are susceptible
to double spend attacks), but also potentially for transactions that don’t
directly involve tokens being sent/received, but that **do** carry explicit or
implicit information that corresponds to value (for example, components of a
cross-chain pool sending updates about their liquidity or oracle updates).

## Head of Casper chain (Justification)

![](https://jumpcrypto-com.ghost.io/content/images/2023/03/ZK-Bridging-4--
1-.png)

### Rundown

A block being justified under Casper is analogous to the completion of the
pre-vote phase in Tendermint. Under the assumption that at least 2/3rds of the
validator set is honest (don’t equivocate), then there will only be one
canonical block that will receive enough votes to be a candidate for finality,
although it’s also important to consider what can happen if this assumption
doesn’t hold. This stage alone isn’t how the condition of finality is
formulated for BFT mechanisms, such as Casper (which require an additional
round of consensus confirming agreement on these votes), but it already
provides a strong assurance against reversion, which as compared to LMD GHOST,
is easier to reason about formally.

### Latency

If consensus is running smoothly, then a checkpoint slot will get justified
every epoch, which is 32 slots, or 6.4 minutes. Given a randomly selected
block/slot, the time to reach one of these checkpoints will have an average of
16 slots, uniformly distributed between 0 and 32.

Since the merge, Casper has smoothly and successfully kept up with this
schedule; however, we can’t be certain that a full round of Casper will always
succeed according to this schedule, as this depends on the liveness of at
least 2/3rds of the validator set. Even in the scenario where >1/3rd of
validators go offline, either due to a correlated outage or a malicious
attempt to halt the chain, Casper is designed to eventually progress again,
without the need for a hard-fork, through the [inactivity
leak](https://eth2book.info/altair/part2/incentives/inactivity?ref=jumpcrypto.com).
Thus, in the worst case, the time for a block to reach justification could
stretch out to days or weeks in the event of a major validator outage. [This
paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1413.pdf?ref=jumpcrypto.com) shows a more
detailed look at attacks that can delay finality, although many of the attack
vectors, such as disrupting Casper by effecting long-range re-orgs under
GHOST, are once again addressed by practical modifications to Ethereum
consensus as it is implemented.

### Reversion Risk

So far, thankfully there hasn’t been a mass equivocation among validators, so
the threat of a conflicting Casper fork hasn't yet materialized in practice.
Whereas the head of the GHOST chain can see a reversion fully within the
protocol rules, with a potentially small subset of validators behaving
maliciously, Casper can only produce ambiguous results if a large portion of
validators are willing to double-sign votes—it would require 1/3rd of
validators at minimum to equivocate in order to accomplish this.

Although there’s no way Ethereum can guarantee that this won’t happen, it does
guarantee that if two conflicting Casper chains successfully reach consensus,
then a minimum of 10.7 million ETH (at the current validator set size of
~500,000) will be burned on both forks. The cases of high-MEV transactions
that don’t involve much “direct” value might be able to safely confirm at this
stage, thanks to the high price of reversion; however, for applications that
involve direct transfers of value, the safer choice is to wait for another
round of consensus to achieve finality.

### Casper Finality

![](https://jumpcrypto-com.ghost.io/content/images/2023/03/ZK-Bridging-5.png)

### Rundown

Finality under Casper is the strongest guarantee that Ethereum’s consensus
provides, requiring an additional round of voting on top of justification.
High-stakes applications where a reversion or a double spend present
existential threats should of course require the highest level of safety
possible.

### Latency

If a block being justified can be compared to the completion of the pre-commit
phase of Tendermint, then achieving finality is similar to the pre-vote phase.
However, Casper is interesting in that it takes these two voting stages and in
some sense “pipelines” them. When validators sign Casper votes, they vote not
for individual checkpoint blocks, but for a transition between two
checkpoints. The process that justifies blocks is the same one that finalizes
them, just phase-shifted back by an epoch. Therefore, the latency between
block finalization follows the same distribution as the latency between
justification, and from the perspective of a particular block of interest, the
expected time to finality is just the time to justification plus another
epoch, adding on another 6.4 minutes. The worst-case consideration is the same
as with justification, requiring a wait until the inactivity leak pushes out
offline validators.

### Reversion Risk

While it’s technically possible to revert finality with just a third of the
validator stake weight, in order to successfully justify and then also
finalize two conflicting forks under Casper, the remaining 2/3rds of the
validator set would have to be perfectly partitioned in order to prevent the
two sides from hearing about the first equivocation and subsequently slashing
the attacker before they could equivocate again to reach finality.

More realistically, in order for an attacker to finalize conflicting blocks
_******without******_ depending on a partition among honest validators, they
would have to control fully 2/3rds of the validator set. Ultimately, the
security of Ethereum comes down to the economic value staked and whether that
produces a high enough threshold (over 20 billion dollars at the current price
of ETH) to prohibit an actor from controlling that proportion of the validator
set.

## Conclusion

In this post, we’ve explored the tradeoff between latency and reversion risk
at the major stages in Ethereum’s current proof-of-stake consensus protocol.
In the next post of our series, we’ll explore the safety guarantees of
optimistic rollups and some of the subtleties that arise when considering
finality there.
