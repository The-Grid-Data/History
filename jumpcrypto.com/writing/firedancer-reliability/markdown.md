![Firedancer Reliability Efforts](https://jumpcrypto-
com.ghost.io/content/images/2022/12/You-Asked---We-Dancered_-21--1-.png)

## TL;DR

 _Backed by decades of experience developing global trading systems operating
at far greater scale than public blockchains, Jump seeks to improve Solana
network reliability by building an independent validator client. We present
Firedancer‚Äôs modular architecture and other security practices to enable
robust high-throughput validator operation._

## Introduction

Solana mainnet block production has stalled on four occasions requiring manual
intervention of hundreds of validator operators to perform a recovery. This
slew of outages has called the reliability of the Solana network into
question.

However, we believe that the Solana protocol itself does not require any
fundamental redesign. Rather, downtime can be attributed to failures in
software modules causing consensus issues ‚Äî some of which have also affected
other blockchain networks in the past.

Enter: Firedancer, a fully independent consensus node for the Solana network
built by the R&D team led by Kevin Bowers.

Firedancer is built to be reliable with a modular architecture, minimal
dependencies, extensive testing plan, and it will operate at a capacity
limited by hardware.

We recognize that this is a difficult effort, but it‚Äôs not the first time Jump
has built highly-reliable global networks. We have industry-leading experience
building best-in-class trading infrastructure in traditional markets that
demand performance measured in nanoseconds.

## Timeline

To understand Solana network reliability, let‚Äôs look into the reasons of the
four historical outages first.

  * 2021-09-14: 17h outage caused by a transaction flood (peer-to-peer interface). [Postmortem by Jump Crypto](https://jumpcrypto.com/reflections-on-the-sept-14-solana-outage?ref=jumpcrypto.com)
  * 2022-04-30: 7h outage caused by a transaction flood (peer-to-peer interface). [Postmortem by Solana Foundation](https://solana.com/news/04-30-22-solana-mainnet-beta-outage-report-mitigation?ref=jumpcrypto.com)
  * 2022-06-01: 4.5h outage caused by a chain split bug (execution layer). [Postmortem by Solana Foundation](https://solana.com/news/06-01-22-solana-mainnet-beta-outage-report-2?ref=jumpcrypto.com)
  * 2022-09-30: 9h outage caused by a fork choice rule bug (consensus layer). [Postmortem by Solana Foundation](https://solana.com/news/09-30-22-solana-mainnet-beta-outage-report?ref=jumpcrypto.com)

One critical non-engineering component has held up, namely **validator
governance**. We find that the validator set is both sufficiently
decentralized and responsive. Solana‚Äôs [Nakamoto
coefficient](https://solana.com/news/validator-health-report-
august-2022?ref=jumpcrypto.com#nakamoto-coefficient) stands strong at 31 and
hundreds of validators collectively have coordinated a network recovery in
just 8 hours.

We present several of these common failure causes and use each to motivate a
design decision in Firedancer that addresses the problem.

## High Performance Packet Processing

The **peer-to-peer interface** is made up of transport protocols driving the
Solana protocol over physical networks.

A historical weakness of Solana‚Äôs peer-to-peer interface is the lack of
congestion control for incoming transactions. Transaction floods halted the
network on 2021-09-14 (17 hours) and 2022-04-30 (7 hours).

### Flow Control

Recent design changes and network upgrades have made the validator more robust
against floods of incoming transactions.

Solana‚Äôs peer-to-peer interface has been upgraded to adopt QUIC, a modern
Internet standard ([RFC 9000](https://www.rfc-
editor.org/rfc/rfc9000.html?ref=jumpcrypto.com)). Serving as the transport
layer of HTTP/3, QUIC also finds widespread adoption across service providers
and commercial DDoS protection services.

Many data centers use specialized hardware that mitigates DDoS attacks for
common communication protocols like TCP and QUIC. Spamming the same
transaction will not increase the probability of confirmation with QUIC,
thereby removing the economic incentive behind transaction floods.

### Network Processing

Even with QUIC, Solana aims to scale up to the gigabit per second realm,
pushing the existing validator to its limits. If a validator fell behind on
packet processing, consensus messages would inevitably get lost.

To give a sense of scale, Solana nodes currently operate at ~0.2 Gbps. The
largest recorded spike on a Jump node was just over 40 Gbps.

As such, performance of networking code directly translates into reliability
when designing the peer-to-peer interface.

Firedancer introduces a novel message-passing framework for composing an
application from highly-performant C ‚Äútiles‚Äù ‚Äì faster than the Linux kernel
allows. Therefore, we bypass kernel networking using
_[AF_XDP](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.18/networking/af_xdp.html?ref=jumpcrypto.com)_
, allowing Firedancer to directly read from network interface buffers.

![](https://jumpcrypto-com.ghost.io/content/images/2022/12/1st.png)Multiple C
tiles reading off of network interface buffers.

The tile system facilitates various high-performance computing concepts such
as [NUMA awareness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-
uniform_memory_access?ref=jumpcrypto.com), [cache
locality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_hierarchy?ref=jumpcrypto.com)
optimization, [lockless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-
blocking_algorithm?ref=jumpcrypto.com#Lock-freedom) concurrency, and [large
page
sizes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_\(computer_memory\)?ref=jumpcrypto.com#Multiple_page_sizes).
We‚Äôll spare you the technical details (for now), but first results show that
Firedancer can reliably accept and filter about 100 Gbps of network traffic on
a typical Solana validator server.

The **modular architecture** of Firedancer tiles should yield an appreciable
improvement in Solana network resiliency.

## Modular Architecture

üí°

Unlike the Solana Rust validator which runs as a single process, Firedancer
consists of many individual C processes called _tiles_.

To understand why the tile system is naturally more resilient to failures
compared to a monolithic design, let‚Äôs take a look at
[CVE-2021-3449](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2021-3449?ref=jumpcrypto.com),
a critical ‚Äú0-day‚Äù vulnerability in the commonly-used OpenSSL server.

### Failure Domains

The two web server implementations in Node.js and NGINX were affected much in
the same way. However, when sending the crash payload to both, NGINX continued
to serve requests just milliseconds after the crash. Most other web servers
crashed.

**Crash Logs: Node.js vs NGINX**

    
    
    $ docker logs -f cve-2021-3449-node &
    server started
    sending initial ClientHello
    connected
    sending malicious ClientHello
    malicious handshake failed, exploit might have worked: EOF
    
    Thread 1 "node" received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
    Container stopped.

The Node.js container stops and requires a restart.

    
    
    $ docker logs -f cve-2021-3449-nginx &
    sending initial ClientHello
    connected
    sending malicious ClientHello
    malicious handshake failed, exploit might have worked: EOF
    
    2021/03/27 03:24:40 [alert] 7: worker process 8 exited on signal 11 (core dumped)
    
    # Still alive?
    sending another ClientHello
    connected

NGINX logs a crash but still responds to requests.

This is owed to NGINX‚Äôs multi-process architecture. Like Firedancer (albeit
simpler), it runs a root process and multiple subprocesses to handle network
traffic. Once a subprocess crashes, it is immediately revived by the root
process which is not directly exposed to untrusted inputs.

In Firedancer, robustness hinges on having small, redundant tiles with
independent failure domains (or as programmers call it, a ‚Äùsmall blast
radius‚Äù).

## Zero-Downtime Upgrades

Firedancer is designed to replace and upgrade every running tile within
seconds without validator downtime.

Tiles store validator state in _workspaces_ (shared memory objects) which
exist as long as a machine is powered on. Upon restarting, each tile simply
picks up processing where it has left off.

Thanks to binary stability in the C runtime model, this mechanism also works
across most software upgrades.

üí°

The ABI is the binary interface that system processes adhere to, similarly to
APIs provided by network services.  
  
[What is an application binary interface
(ABI)?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2171177/what-is-an-application-
binary-interface-abi?ref=jumpcrypto.com)

Comparatively, the Rust validator has to fully shut down ahead of upgrades
because lack of ABI stability makes it impossible to implement on-the-fly
upgrades in pure Rust. The compiler might arbitrarily change the layout of
data structures when changing the `rustc` version or internal dependencies.

Finally, we aim to drastically reduce vote downtime resulting from validator
upgrades from the current ten minutes.

## Runtime Correctness

Our final stop in the road to reliability is the **consensus** and **execution
layers**. (The lines between consensus and execution are somewhat blurred in
Solana, as both lay in the same blockchain network.)

Every public blockchain, including Solana, uses a variation of the following
steps.

  1. **Ordering** : Pack incoming transactions into blocks.
  2. **Consensus** : Determine the canonical fork (attestation/voting on PoS or mining on PoW).
  3. **Execution** : Apply each transaction and validate resulting state.

It is critical that these steps happen deterministically across the network.

Simply put, every step must have identical outcomes on every node. One of the
innovations of public blockchains is the ability to independently verify any
data without trust assumptions. So, by design, any diverging behavior causes a
**chain split**.

Blockchain systems ‚Äì from Solana to Tendermint-based chains ‚Äì continue to be
affected by bugs in [ordering](https://github.com/osmosis-
labs/osmosis/pull/2937?ref=jumpcrypto.com),
[consensus](https://solana.com/news/09-30-22-solana-mainnet-beta-outage-
report?ref=jumpcrypto.com), and most commonly, execution
([1](https://solana.com/news/06-01-22-solana-mainnet-beta-outage-
report-2?ref=jumpcrypto.com), [2](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-
sdk/pull/12781?ref=jumpcrypto.com)) in recent times.

Bitcoin (execution bug in
[2013](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0050.mediawiki?ref=jumpcrypto.com))
and Ethereum (execution bugs in
[2020](https://chainstack.com/block-11234873-and-the-geth-chain-
split/?ref=jumpcrypto.com),
[2021](https://github.com/openethereum/openethereum/issues/353?ref=jumpcrypto.com))
have had partial outages and caused erroneous transaction confirmations. Block
production has continued, however, as Nakamoto consensus-based systems favor
availability over consistency.

Other proof-of-stake systems such as Solana do the opposite: when a fork fails
to meet the
[supermajority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority?ref=jumpcrypto.com)
of stake for an extended period, block production stops.

üëâ

Refer to our writeup from last year on [safety vs
liveness](https://jumpcrypto.com/reflections-on-the-sept-14-solana-
outage/?ref=jumpcrypto.com#safety-vs-liveness).

Luckily, network outages are preventable. The classes of vulnerabilities are
well known and we have enough engineering resources to identify and address
them. In fact, most chain split bugs have been caught during testing before
they ever reached a live network.

Jump has developed extensive **testing** frameworks for its core trading
infrastructure and looks forward to applying lessons learned to Firedancer.

## Testing Roadmap

By far, the biggest security/reliability effort is a rigorous testing roadmap.

### Test Networks

Integration testing is crucial when introducing a new validator to mainnet. As
such, Jump and Solana Labs will run test networks made up of both validator
clients.

While it is impossible to comprehensively mirror the nature of mainnet, we can
still test individual properties to analyze safety. Taking inspiration from
the successful Ethereum merge procedure, test networks will be subjected to
various attacks and failures such as duplicate nodes, failing network links,
packet floods, consensus violations, and more.

Just like we test high-frequency trading systems at Jump, these networks are
going to be subjected to significantly higher loads than any realistic
scenario on mainnet.

### Fuzz Testing

We complement manual reviews, fixtures, and real-world tests with automated
fuzzing to try to weed out particularly hidden bugs. This process involves
running thousands of automated test inputs per second on code targets, then
running coherence checks on the execution result. Coverage-guided fuzzing
engines such as [LLVM
libFuzzer](https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html?ref=jumpcrypto.com) and
[AFL++](https://aflplus.plus/?ref=jumpcrypto.com) optimize for code coverage
(i.e. creating a diverse corpus of inputs that reaches as much code as
possible).

[EVMFuzz](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.08483.pdf?ref=jumpcrypto.com) revealed at
least five instances of unsound behavior in Ethereum, proving its
effectiveness at finding critical blockchain vulnerabilities. Each of these
could have caused a chain split on Ethereum.

The Solana protocol has naturally developed with the validator written by
Solana Labs. However, up to this point, much of the protocol was
implementation-defined.

Firedancer defines fuzzing targets for every component that accepts untrusted
user inputs, including the P2P interface (parsers) and the SBF virtual
machine. OSS-Fuzz continually maintains fuzz coverage throughout code changes,
which integrates nicely with Firedancer's
[rules_fuzzing](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_fuzzing?ref=jumpcrypto.com)
build targets. To date, OSS-Fuzz has found [over 40000
bugs](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-
fuzz/issues/list?q=-status%3AWontFix%2CDuplicate+-component%3AInfra&can=1&ref=jumpcrypto.com)
in various open source projects including Chromium and GCC.

## Specifications

We are working to produce specification documents to define the _Solana
protocol_. In the end, one should be able to create a Solana validator just by
looking at the documentation, not the Rust validator code.

![](https://jumpcrypto-com.ghost.io/content/images/2022/12/Frame-1.png)Mind-
map of major Solana network components

Aside from helping Firedancer stay compatible in the long run, we hope that
comprehensive documentation enables other teams to build their own clients.
Ultimately, Solana and the Sealevel VM should grow to become an open standard
governed by a diverse community of core contributors.

## Supply Chain Security

We want to be confident in every line of code that the validator executes.
This requirement forces us to consider not only our own code but also external
sources.

In fact, many Node.js, Rust, and even Go projects are known to have large
dependency trees which make up the vast majority of source code. This is
driven by modern package managers ‚Äì tools that trivialize sharing and using
open-source modules.

Example: Geth, the majority Ethereum execution client, pulls in over 250 other
Go modules as dependencies. Meanwhile, the Solana Rust implementation depends
on around 750 Rust modules.

    
    
    # Don't believe us? Verify it!
    
    curl -sS 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/master/go.sum' | awk '{ print $1 }' | sort -u | wc -l
    271

For node software, _software supply chain security_ is critical, as a
compromise in a single package affects an entire validator. The only measure
one can take is reviewing and updating every external dependency regularly
(possibly millions of lines of code for large dependency trees).

### Build System

To avoid many of the problems that come with a complex supply chain,
Firedancer instead focuses on simplicity and security.

The Firedancer build system is designed around the following set of rules.

  1. Use minimal amount of external dependencies.
  2. Treat not just code, but all tools involved in the build process as dependencies.
  3. Pin every dependency (including code compilers) to an exact version.
  4. Isolate the system environment from build steps (portability).

Regardless of environment, the build system produces byte-by-byte reproducible
outputs.

For those reasons, we chose the
[Bazel](https://bazel.build/about?ref=jumpcrypto.com) build system, which puts
emphasis on
**[hermeticity](https://bazel.build/basics/hermeticity?ref=jumpcrypto.com)**.
Bazel is also trusted by companies like
[SpaceX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_3bckhV_YI&ref=jumpcrypto.com) and
[BMW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh4SJuYUoQI&ref=jumpcrypto.com) for
high-reliability software.

## Conclusion

Learning from past network events, we are well-equipped to tackle the various
modes of failure moving forward. Would Firedancer have stopped previous
outages?

Possibly, but we didn‚Äôt design Firedancer by just looking in the rearview
mirror. Firedancer is not a short-term patch or a bug fix. While it may not
stop every future issue, we believe Firedancer will enhance the resiliency and
robustness of the Solana network.

Meanwhile, the research arm of the project is working to support an ultra-
high-bandwidth mode of operation using hardware acceleration (FPGAs) and
custom networks. Firedancer will push the bounds of computing to offer scale
and reliability to the Solana community. We are ready for the future.
