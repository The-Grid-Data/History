Blocks are batches of transactions with a hash of the previous block in the
chain. This links blocks together (in a chain) because hashes are
cryptographically derived from the block data. This prevents fraud, because
one change in any block in history would invalidate all the following blocks
as all subsequent hashes would change and everyone running the blockchain
would notice.

## Prerequisites

Blocks are a very beginner-friendly topic. But to help you better understand
this page, we recommend you first read
[Accounts](/en/developers/docs/accounts/),
[Transactions](/en/developers/docs/transactions/), and our [introduction to
Ethereum](/en/developers/docs/intro-to-ethereum/).

## Why blocks?

To ensure that all participants on the Ethereum network maintain a
synchronized state and agree on the precise history of transactions, we batch
transactions into blocks. This means dozens (or hundreds) of transactions are
committed, agreed on, and synchronized all at once.

[![A diagram showing transaction in a block causing state
changes](/_next/image/?url=%2Fcontent%2Fdevelopers%2Fdocs%2Fblocks%2Ftx-
block.png&w=1920&q=75)](/content/developers/docs/blocks/tx-block.png) _Diagram
adapted from[Ethereum EVM illustrated(opens in a new tab)](https://takenobu-
hs.github.io/downloads/ethereum_evm_illustrated.pdf)_

By spacing out commits, we give all network participants enough time to come
to consensus: even though transaction requests occur dozens of times per
second, blocks are only created and committed on Ethereum once every twelve
seconds.

## How blocks work

To preserve the transaction history, blocks are strictly ordered (every new
block created contains a reference to its parent block), and transactions
within blocks are strictly ordered as well. Except in rare cases, at any given
time, all participants on the network are in agreement on the exact number and
history of blocks, and are working to batch the current live transaction
requests into the next block.

Once a block is put together by a randomly selected validator on the network,
it is propagated to the rest of the network; all nodes add this block to the
end of their blockchain, and a new validator is selected to create the next
block. The exact block-assembly process and commitment/consensus process is
currently specified by Ethereum’s “proof-of-stake” protocol.

## Proof-of-stake protocol

Proof-of-stake means the following:

  * Validating nodes have to stake 32 ETH into a deposit contract as collateral against bad behavior. This helps protect the network because provably dishonest activity leads to some or all of that stake being destroyed.
  * In every slot (spaced twelve seconds apart) a validator is randomly selected to be the block proposer. They bundle transactions together, execute them and determine a new 'state'. They wrap this information into a block and pass it around to other validators.
  * Other validators who hear about the new block re-execute the transactions to ensure they agree with the proposed change to the global state. Assuming the block is valid, they add it to their own database.
  * If a validator hears about two conflicting blocks for the same slot they use their fork-choice algorithm to pick the one supported by the most staked ETH.

[More on proof-of-stake](/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/)

## What's in a block?

There is a lot of information contained within a block. At the highest level a
block contains the following fields:

Field| Description  
---|---  
`slot`| the slot the block belongs to  
`proposer_index`| the ID of the validator proposing the block  
`parent_root`| the hash of the preceding block  
`state_root`| the root hash of the state object  
`body`| an object containing several fields, as defined below  
  
The block `body` contains several fields of its own:

Field| Description  
---|---  
`randao_reveal`| a value used to select the next block proposer  
`eth1_data`| information about the deposit contract  
`graffiti`| arbitrary data used to tag blocks  
`proposer_slashings`| list of validators to be slashed  
`attester_slashings`| list of attesters to be slashed  
`attestations`| list of attestations in favor of the current block  
`deposits`| list of new deposits to the deposit contract  
`voluntary_exits`| list of validators exiting the network  
`sync_aggregate`| subset of validators used to serve light clients  
`execution_payload`| transactions passed from the execution client  
  
The `attestations` field contains a list of all the attestations in the block.
Attestations have their own data type that contains several pieces of data.
Each attestation contains:

Field| Description  
---|---  
`aggregation_bits`| a list of which validators participated in this
attestation  
`data`| a container with multiple subfields  
`signature`| aggregate signature of all attesting validators  
  
The `data` field in the `attestation` contains the following:

Field| Description  
---|---  
`slot`| the slot the attestation relates to  
`index`| indices for attesting validators  
`beacon_block_root`| the root hash of the Beacon block containing this object  
`source`| the last justified checkpoint  
`target`| the latest epoch boundary block  
  
Executing the transactions in the `execution_payload` updates the global
state. All clients re-execute the transactions in the `execution_payload` to
ensure the new state matches that in the new block `state_root` field. This is
how clients can tell that a new block is valid and safe to add to their
blockchain. The `execution payload` itself is an object with several fields.
There is also an `execution_payload_header` that contains important summary
information about the execution data. These data structures are organized as
follows:

The `execution_payload_header` contains the following fields:

Field| Description  
---|---  
`parent_hash`| hash of the parent block  
`fee_recipient`| account address for paying transaction fees to  
`state_root`| root hash for the global state after applying changes in this
block  
`receipts_root`| hash of the transaction receipts trie  
`logs_bloom`| data structure containing event logs  
`prev_randao`| value used in random validator selection  
`block_number`| the number of the current block  
`gas_limit`| maximum gas allowed in this block  
`gas_used`| the actual amount of gas used in this block  
`timestamp`| the block time  
`extra_data`| arbitrary additional data as raw bytes  
`base_fee_per_gas`| the base fee value  
`block_hash`| Hash of execution block  
`transactions_root`| root hash of the transactions in the payload  
`withdrawal_root`| root hash of the withdrawals in the payload  
  
The `execution_payload` itself contains the following (notice this is
identical to the header except that instead of the root hash of the
transactions it includes the actual list of transactions and withdrawal
information) :

Field| Description  
---|---  
`parent_hash`| hash of the parent block  
`fee_recipient`| account address for paying transaction fees to  
`state_root`| root hash for the global state after applying changes in this
block  
`receipts_root`| hash of the transaction receipts trie  
`logs_bloom`| data structure containing event logs  
`prev_randao`| value used in random validator selection  
`block_number`| the number of the current block  
`gas_limit`| maximum gas allowed in this block  
`gas_used`| the actual amount of gas used in this block  
`timestamp`| the block time  
`extra_data`| arbitrary additional data as raw bytes  
`base_fee_per_gas`| the base fee value  
`block_hash`| Hash of execution block  
`transactions`| list of transactions to be executed  
`withdrawals`| list of withdrawal objects  
  
The `withdrawals` list contains `withdrawal` objects structured in the
following way:

Field| Description  
---|---  
`address`| account address that has withdrawn  
`amount`| withdrawal amount  
`index`| withdrawal index value  
`validatorIndex`| validator index value  
  
## Block time

Block time refers to the time separating blocks. In Ethereum, time is divided
up into twelve second units called 'slots'. In each slot a single validator is
selected to propose a block. Assuming all validators are online and fully
functional there will be a block in every slot, meaning the block time is 12s.
However, occasionally validators might be offline when called to propose a
block, meaning slots can sometimes go empty.

This implementation differs from proof-of-work based systems where block times
are probabilistic and tuned by the protocol's target mining difficulty.
Ethereum's [average block time(opens in a new
tab)](https://etherscan.io/chart/blocktime) is a perfect example of this
whereby the transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake can be clearly
inferred based on the consistency of the new 12s block time.

## Block size

A final important note is that blocks themselves are bounded in size. Each
block has a target size of 15 million gas but the size of blocks will increase
or decrease in accordance with network demands, up until the block limit of 30
million gas (2x target block size). The total amount of gas expended by all
transactions in the block must be less than the block gas limit. This is
important because it ensures that blocks can’t be arbitrarily large. If blocks
could be arbitrarily large, then less performant full nodes would gradually
stop being able to keep up with the network due to space and speed
requirements. The larger the block, the greater the computing power required
to process them in time for the next slot. This is a centralizing force, which
is resisted by capping block sizes.
