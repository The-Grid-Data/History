The term 'consensus mechanism' is often used colloquially to refer to 'proof-
of-stake', 'proof-of-work' or 'proof-of-authority' protocols. However, these
are just components in consensus mechanisms that protect against Sybil
attacks. Consensus mechanisms are the complete stack of ideas, protocols and
incentives that enable a distributed set of nodes to agree on the state of a
blockchain.

## Prerequisites

To better understand this page, we recommend you first read our [introduction
to Ethereum](/en/developers/docs/intro-to-ethereum/).

## What is consensus?

By consensus, we mean that a general agreement has been reached. Consider a
group of people going to the cinema. If there is no disagreement on a proposed
choice of film, then a consensus is achieved. If there is disagreement, the
group must have the means to decide which film to see. In extreme cases, the
group will eventually split.

In regard to the Ethereum blockchain, the process is formalized, and reaching
consensus means that at least 66% of the nodes on the network agree on the
global state of the network.

## What is a consensus mechanism?

The term consensus mechanism refers to the entire stack of protocols,
incentives and ideas that allow a network of nodes to agree on the state of a
blockchain.

Ethereum uses a proof-of-stake-based consensus mechanism that derives its
crypto-economic security from a set of rewards and penalties applied to
capital locked by stakers. This incentive structure encourages individual
stakers to operate honest validators, punishes those who don't, and creates an
extremely high cost to attack the network.

Then, there is a protocol that governs how honest validators are selected to
propose or validate blocks, process transactions and vote for their view of
the head of the chain. In the rare situations where multiple blocks are in the
same position near the head of the chain, there is a fork-choice mechanism
that selects blocks that make up the 'heaviest' chain, measured by the number
of validators that voted for the blocks weighted by their staked ether
balance.

Some concepts are important to consensus that are not explicitly defined in
code, such as the additional security offered by potential out-of-band social
coordination as a last line of defense against attacks on the network.

These components together form the consensus mechanism.

## Types of consensus mechanisms

### Proof-of-work based

Like Bitcoin, Ethereum once used a **proof-of-work (PoW)** based consensus
protocol.

#### Block creation

Miners compete to create new blocks filled with processed transactions. The
winner shares the new block with the rest of the network and earns some
freshly minted ETH. The race is won by the computer which is able to solve a
math puzzle fastest. This produces the cryptographic link between the current
block and the block that went before. Solving this puzzle is the work in
"proof-of-work". The canonical chain is then determined by a fork-choice rule
that selects the set of blocks that have had the most work done to mine them.

#### Security

The network is kept secure by the fact that you'd need 51% of the network's
computing power to defraud the chain. This would require such huge investments
in equipment and energy; you're likely to spend more than you'd gain.

More on [proof-of-work](/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/)

### Proof-of-stake based

Ethereum now uses a **proof-of-stake (PoS)** based consensus protocol.

#### Block creation

Validators create blocks. One validator is randomly selected in each slot to
be the block proposer. Their consensus client requests a bundle of
transactions as an 'execution payload' from their paired execution client.
They wrap this in consensus data to form a block, which they send to other
nodes on the Ethereum network. This block production is rewarded in ETH. In
rare cases when multiple possible blocks exist for a single slot, or nodes
hear about blocks at different times, the fork choice algorithm picks the
block that forms the chain with the greatest weight of attestations (where
weight is the number of validators attesting scaled by their ETH balance).

#### Security

A proof-of-stake system is secure crypto-economically because an attacker
attempting to take control of the chain must destroy a massive amount of ETH.
A system of rewards incentivizes individual stakers to behave honestly, and
penalties disincentivize stakers from acting maliciously.

More on [proof-of-stake](/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/)

### A visual guide

Watch more on the different types of consensus mechanisms used on Ethereum:

### Sybil resistance & chain selection

Proof-of-work and proof-of-stake alone are not consensus protocols, but they
are often referred to as such for simplicity. They are actually Sybil
resistance mechanisms and block author selectors; they are a way to decide who
is the author of the latest block. Another important component is the chain
selection (aka fork choice) algorithm that enables nodes to pick one single
correct block at the head of the chain in scenarios where multiple blocks
exist in the same position.

**Sybil resistance** measures how a protocol fares against a [Sybil
attack(opens in a new tab)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack). Sybil
attacks are when one user or group pretends to be many users. Resistance to
this type of attack is essential for a decentralized blockchain and enables
miners and validators to be rewarded equally based on resources put in. Proof-
of-work and proof-of-stake protect against this by making users expend a lot
of energy or put up a lot of collateral. These protections are an economic
deterrent to Sybil attacks.

A **chain selection rule** is used to decide which chain is the "correct"
chain. Bitcoin uses the "longest chain" rule, which means that whichever
blockchain is the longest will be the one the rest of the nodes accept as
valid and work with. For proof-of-work chains, the longest chain is determined
by the chain's total cumulative proof-of-work difficulty. Ethereum used to use
the longest chain rule too; however, now that Ethereum runs on proof-of-stake
it adopted an updated fork-choice algorithm that measures the 'weight' of the
chain. The weight is the accumulated sum of validator votes, weighted by
validator staked-ether balances.

Ethereum uses a consensus mechanism known as
[Gasper](/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/gasper/) that combines
[Casper FFG proof-of-stake(opens in a new
