## Introduction

Many Ethereum development standards focus on token interfaces. These standards
help ensure smart contracts remain composable, so for instance when a new
project issues a token, that it remains compatible with existing decentralized
exchanges.

## Prerequisites

  * [Ethereum development standards](/en/developers/docs/standards/)
  * [Smart contracts](/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/)

## Token standards

Here are some of the most popular token standards on Ethereum:

  * [ERC-20](/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) \- A standard interface for fungible (interchangeable) tokens, like voting tokens, staking tokens or virtual currencies.
  * [ERC-721](/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/) \- A standard interface for non-fungible tokens, like a deed for artwork or a song.
  * [ERC-777](/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-777/) \- ERC-777 allows people to build extra functionality on top of tokens such as a mixer contract for improved transaction privacy or an emergency recover function to bail you out if you lose your private keys.
  * [ERC-1155](/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-1155/) \- ERC-1155 allows for more efficient trades and bundling of transactions – thus saving costs. This token standard allows for creating both utility tokens (such as $BNB or $BAT) and Non-Fungible Tokens like CryptoPunks.
  * [ERC-4626](/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-4626/) \- A tokenized vault standard designed to optimize and unify the technical parameters of yield-bearing vaults.
