## Standards overview

The Ethereum community has adopted many standards that help keep projects
(such as [Ethereum clients](/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/) and
wallets) interoperable across implementations, and ensure smart contracts and
dapps remain composable.

Typically standards are introduced as [Ethereum Improvement
Proposals](/en/eips/) (EIPs), which are discussed by community members through
a [standard process(opens in a new
tab)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1).

  * [Introduction to EIPs](/en/eips/)
  * [List of EIPs(opens in a new tab)](https://eips.ethereum.org/)
  * [EIP GitHub repo(opens in a new tab)](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs)
  * [EIP discussion board(opens in a new tab)](https://ethereum-magicians.org/c/eips)
  * [Introduction to Ethereum Governance](/en/governance/)
  * [Ethereum Governance Overview(opens in a new tab)](https://web.archive.org/web/20201107234050/https://blog.bmannconsulting.com/ethereum-governance/) _March 31, 2019 - Boris Mann_
  * [Ethereum Protocol Development Governance and Network Upgrade Coordination(opens in a new tab)](https://hudsonjameson.com/2020-03-23-ethereum-protocol-development-governance-and-network-upgrade-coordination/) _March 23, 2020 - Hudson Jameson_
  * [Playlist of all Ethereum Core Dev Meetings(opens in a new tab)](https://www.youtube.com/@EthereumProtocol) _(YouTube Playlist)_

## Types of standards

There are 3 types of EIPs:

  * Standards Track: describes any change that affects most or all Ethereum implementations
  * [Meta Track(opens in a new tab)](https://eips.ethereum.org/meta): describes a process surrounding Ethereum or proposes a change to a process
  * [Informational Track(opens in a new tab)](https://eips.ethereum.org/informational): describes an Ethereum design issue or provides general guidelines or information to the Ethereum community

Furthermore, the Standard Track is subdivided into 4 categories:

  * [Core(opens in a new tab)](https://eips.ethereum.org/core): improvements requiring a consensus fork
  * [Networking(opens in a new tab)](https://eips.ethereum.org/networking): improvements around devp2p and Light Ethereum Subprotocol, as well as proposed improvements to network protocol specifications of whisper and swarm.
  * [Interface(opens in a new tab)](https://eips.ethereum.org/interface): improvements around client API/RPC specifications and standards, and certain language-level standards like method names and contract ABIs.
  * [ERC(opens in a new tab)](https://eips.ethereum.org/erc): application-level standards and conventions

More detailed information on these different types and categories can be found
in [EIP-1(opens in a new tab)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1#eip-types)

### Token standards

  * [ERC-20](/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) \- A standard interface for fungible (interchangeable) tokens, like voting tokens, staking tokens or virtual currencies.
    * [ERC-1363(opens in a new tab)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1363) \- Defines a token interface for ERC-20 tokens that supports executing recipient code after transfer or transferFrom, or spender code after approve.
  * [ERC-721](/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/) \- A standard interface for non-fungible tokens, like a deed for artwork or a song.
    * [ERC-2309(opens in a new tab)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2309) \- A standardized event emitted when creating/transferring one, or many non-fungible tokens using consecutive token identifiers.
    * [ERC-4400(opens in a new tab)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4400) \- Interface extension for EIP-721 consumer role.
    * [ERC-4907(opens in a new tab)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4907) \- Add a time-limited role with restricted permissions to ERC-721 tokens.
  * [ERC-777](/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-777/) \- **(NOT RECOMMENDED)** A token standard improving over ERC-20.
  * [ERC-1155](/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-1155/) \- A token standard which can contain both fungible and non-fungible assets.
  * [ERC-4626](/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-4626/) \- A tokenized vault standard designed to optimize and unify the technical parameters of yield-bearing vaults.
