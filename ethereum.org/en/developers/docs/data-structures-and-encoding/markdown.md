  * Prerequisites
  * Data structures
    * Patricia merkle tries
    * Recursive Length Prefix
    * Simple Serialize

Ethereum creates, stores and transfers large volumes of data. This data must
get formatted in standardized and memory-efficient ways to allow anyone to
[run a node](/en/run-a-node/) on relatively modest consumer-grade hardware. To
achieve this, several specific data structures are used on the Ethereum stack.

## Prerequisites

You should understand the fundamentals of Ethereum and [client
software](/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/). Familiarity with the
networking layer and [the Ethereum whitepaper](/en/whitepaper/) is
recommended.

## Data structures

### Patricia merkle tries

Patricia Merkle Tries are structures that encode key-value pairs into a
deterministic and cryptographically authenticated trie. These are used
extensively across Ethereum's execution layer.

[More on Patricia Merkle Tries](/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-
encoding/patricia-merkle-trie/)

### Recursive Length Prefix

Recursive Length Prefix (RLP) is a serialization method used extensively
across Ethereum's execution layer.

[More on RLP](/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/rlp/)

### Simple Serialize

Simple Serialize (SSZ) is the dominant serialization format on Ethereum's
consensus layer because of its compatibility with merklelization.

[More on SSZ](/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/ssz/)
