Learn how to develop for Ethereum using Ruby-based projects and tooling.

Use Ethereum to create decentralized applications (or "dapps") that utilize
the benefits of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. These dapps can be
trustless, meaning that once they are deployed to Ethereum, they will always
run as programmed. They can control digital assets to create new kinds of
financial applications. They can be decentralized, meaning that no single
entity or person controls them and are nearly impossible to censor.

## Getting started with smart contracts and the Solidity language

**Take your first steps to integrating Ruby with Ethereum**
