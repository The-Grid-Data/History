Learn how to develop for Ethereum using Go-based projects and tooling

Use Ethereum to create decentralized applications (or "dapps"). These dapps
can be trustworthy, meaning that once they are deployed to Ethereum, they will
always run as programmed. They are decentralized, meaning that they run on a
peer-to-peer network and there is no single point of failure. No single entity
or person controls them and they are nearly impossible to censor. They can
control digital assets in order to create new kinds of applications.

## Getting started with smart contracts and the Solidity language

**Take your first steps to integrating Go with Ethereum**
