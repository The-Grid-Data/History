  * Choose your language
    * What if my language is not supported

A common misconception is that developers must write [smart
contracts](/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/) in order to build on
Ethereum. This is false. One of the beauties of the Ethereum network and
community is that you're able to [participate](/en/community/) in just about
any programming language.

Ethereum and its community embrace open source. You can find community
projects - client implementations, APIs, development frameworks, testing tools
- in a wide variety of languages.

## Choose your language

Select your programming language of choice to find projects, resources, and
virtual communities:

  * [Ethereum for Dart developers](/en/developers/docs/programming-languages/dart/)
  * [Ethereum for Delphi developers](/en/developers/docs/programming-languages/delphi/)
  * [Ethereum for .NET developers](/en/developers/docs/programming-languages/dot-net/)
  * [Ethereum for Go developers](/en/developers/docs/programming-languages/golang/)
  * [Ethereum for Java developers](/en/developers/docs/programming-languages/java/)
  * [Ethereum for JavaScript developers](/en/developers/docs/programming-languages/javascript/)
  * [Ethereum for Python developers](/en/developers/docs/programming-languages/python/)
  * [Ethereum for Ruby developers](/en/developers/docs/programming-languages/ruby/)
  * [Ethereum for Rust developers](/en/developers/docs/programming-languages/rust/)

### What if my language is not supported

If you want to link to resources or point to a virtual community for an
additional programming language you can request a new page by [opening an
issue(opens in a new tab)](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-
website/issues/new/choose).

If you just want to write code to interface with the blockchain using a
currently unsupported language you can use the [JSON-RPC
interface](/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/) to connect to the Ethereum
network. Any programming language that can use TCP/IP can use this interface.
