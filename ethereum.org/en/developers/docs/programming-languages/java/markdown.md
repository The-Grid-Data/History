Learn how to develop for Ethereum using Java-based projects and tooling

Use Ethereum to create decentralized applications (or "dapps") that utilize
the benefits of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. These dapps can be
trustworthy, meaning that once they are deployed to Ethereum, they will always
run as programmed. They can control digital assets in order to create new
kinds of financial applications. They can be decentralized, meaning that no
single entity or person controls them and are nearly impossible to censor.

## Getting started with smart contracts and the Solidity language

**Take your first steps to integrating Java with Ethereum**
