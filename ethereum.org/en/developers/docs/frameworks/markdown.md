## Introduction to frameworks

Building a full-fledged dapp requires different pieces of technology. Software
frameworks include many of the needed features or provide easy plugin systems
to pick the tools you desire.

Frameworks come with a lot of out-of-the-box functionality, like:

  * Features to spin up a local blockchain instance.
  * Utilities to compile and test your smart contracts.
  * Client development add-ons to build your user-facing application within the same project/repository.
  * Configuration to connect to Ethereum networks and deploy contracts, whether to a locally running instance, or one of Ethereum's public networks.
  * Decentralized app distribution - integrations with storage options like IPFS.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into frameworks, we recommend you first read through our
introduction to [dapps](/en/developers/docs/dapps/) and the [Ethereum
stack](/en/developers/docs/ethereum-stack/).
