## Introduction

Running your own [Ethereum node](/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/#what-
are-nodes-and-clients) can be challenging, especially when getting started or
while scaling fast. There are a number of services that run optimized node
infrastructures for you, so you can focus on developing your application or
product instead. We'll explain how node services work, the pros and cons for
using them and list providers if you are interested in getting started.

## Prerequisites

If you don't already have an understanding of what nodes and clients are,
check out [Nodes and clients](/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/).

## Stakers

Solo stakers must run their own infrastructure rather than relying on third-
party providers. This means running an execution client coupled with a
consensus client. Before [The Merge](/en/roadmap/merge/), it was possible to
run a consensus client only and use a centralized provider for execution data;
this is no longer possible - a solo staker must run both clients. However,
there are services available to ease this process.

[Read more on running a node](/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/run-a-
node/).

The services described on this page are for non-staking nodes.

## How do node services work?

Node service providers run distributed node clients behind the scenes for you,
so you don't have to.

These services typically provide an API key that you can use to write to and
read from the blockchain. They often include access to [Ethereum
testnets](/en/developers/docs/networks/#ethereum-testnets) in addition to
Mainnet.

Some services offer you your own dedicated node that they manage for you,
while others use load balancers to distribute activity across nodes.

Almost all node services are extremely easy to integrate with, involving one
line changes in your code to swap out your self hosted node, or even switch
between the services themselves.

Often times node services will run a variety of [node
clients](/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/#execution-clients) and
[types](/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/#node-types), allowing you to
access full and archive nodes in addition to client specific methods in one
API.

It's important to note that node services do not and should not store your
private keys or information.

## What are the benefits of using a node service?

The main benefit for using a node service is not having to spend engineering
time maintaining and managing nodes yourself. This allows you to focus on
building your product rather than having to worry about infrastructure
maintenance.

Running your own nodes can be very expensive from storage to bandwidth to
valuable engineering time. Things like spinning up more nodes when scaling,
upgrading nodes to the latest versions, and ensuring state consistency, can
distract from building and spending resources on your desired web3 product.

## What are the cons of using a Node Service?

By using a node service you are centralizing the infrastructure aspect of your
product. For this reason, projects that hold decentralization to the upmost
importance might prefer self-hosting nodes rather than outsourcing to a 3rd
party.

Read more about the [benefits of running your own
node](/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/#benefits-to-you).

## Popular node services

Here is a list of some of the most popular Ethereum node providers, feel free
to add any that are missing! Each node service offers different benefits and
features in addition to free or paid tiers, you should investigate which ones
best suit your needs prior to making a decision.
