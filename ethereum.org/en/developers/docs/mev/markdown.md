Maximal extractable value (MEV) refers to the maximum value that can be
extracted from block production in excess of the standard block reward and gas
fees by including, excluding, and changing the order of transactions in a
block.

## Maximal extractable value

Maximal extractable value was first applied in the context of [proof-of-
work](/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/), and initially referred
to as "miner extractable value". This is because in proof-of-work, miners
control transaction inclusion, exclusion, and ordering. However, since the
transition to proof-of-stake via [The Merge](/en/roadmap/merge/) validators
have been responsible for these roles, and mining is no longer part of the
Ethereum protocol. The value extraction methods still exist, though, so the
term "Maximal extractable value" is now used instead.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you're familiar with
[transactions](/en/developers/docs/transactions/),
[blocks](/en/developers/docs/blocks/), [proof-of-
stake](/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/) and
[gas](/en/developers/docs/gas/). Familiarity with [dapps](/en/dapps/) and
[DeFi](/en/defi/) is helpful as well.

## MEV extraction

In theory MEV accrues entirely to validators because they are the only party
that can guarantee the execution of a profitable MEV opportunity. In practice,
however, a large portion of MEV is extracted by independent network
participants referred to as "searchers." Searchers run complex algorithms on
blockchain data to detect profitable MEV opportunities and have bots to
automatically submit those profitable transactions to the network.

Validators do get a portion of the full MEV amount anyway because searchers
are willing to pay high gas fees (which go to the validator) in exchange for
higher likelihood of inclusion of their profitable transactions in a block.
Assuming searchers are economically rational, the gas fee that a searcher is
willing to pay will be an amount up to 100% of the searcher's MEV (because if
the gas fee was higher, the searcher would lose money).

With that, for some highly competitive MEV opportunities, such as DEX
arbitrage, searchers may have to pay 90% or even more of their total MEV
revenue in gas fees to the validator because so many people want to run the
same profitable arbitrage trade. This is because the only way to guarantee
that their arbitrage transaction runs is if they submit the transaction with
the highest gas price.

### Gas golfing

This dynamic has made being good at "gas golfing" — programming transactions
so that they use the least amount of gas — a competitive advantage, because it
allows searchers to set a higher gas price while keeping their total gas fees
constant (since gas fees = gas price * gas used).

A few well-known gas golf techniques include: using addresses that start with
a long string of zeroes (e.g.
[0x0000000000C521824EaFf97Eac7B73B084ef9306(opens in a new
tab)](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0000000000c521824eaff97eac7b73b084ef9306))
since they take less space (and hence gas) to store; and leaving small
[ERC-20](/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) token balances in
contracts, since it costs more gas to initialize a storage slot (the case if
the balance is 0) than to update a storage slot. Finding more techniques to
reduce gas usage is an active area of research among searchers.

### Generalized frontrunners

Rather than programming complex algorithms to detect profitable MEV
opportunities, some searchers run generalized frontrunners. Generalized
frontrunners are bots that watch the mempool to detect profitable
transactions. The frontrunner will copy the potentially profitable
transaction's code, replace addresses with the frontrunner's address, and run
the transaction locally to double-check that the modified transaction results
in a profit to the frontrunner's address. If the transaction is indeed
profitable, the frontrunner will submit the modified transaction with the
replaced address and a higher gas price, "frontrunning" the original
transaction and getting the original searcher's MEV.

### Flashbots

Flashbots is an independent project which extends execution clients with a
service that allows searchers to submit MEV transactions to validators without
revealing them to the public mempool. This prevents transactions from being
frontrun by generalized frontrunners.

## MEV examples

MEV emerges on the blockchain in a few ways.

### DEX arbitrage

 _Decentralized exchange_ (DEX) arbitrage is the simplest and most well-known
MEV opportunity. As a result, it is also the most competitive.

It works like this: if two DEXes are offering a token at two different prices,
someone can buy the token on the lower-priced DEX and sell it on the higher-
priced DEX in a single, atomic transaction. Thanks to the mechanics of the
blockchain, this is true, riskless arbitrage.

[Here's an example(opens in a new
tab)](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5e1657ef0e9be9bc72efefe59a2528d0d730d478cfc9e6cdd09af9f997bb3ef4)
of a profitable arbitrage transaction where a searcher turned 1,000 ETH into
1,045 ETH by taking advantage of different pricing of the ETH/DAI pair on
Uniswap vs. Sushiswap.

### Liquidations

Lending protocol liquidations present another well-known MEV opportunity.

Lending protocols like Maker and Aave require users to deposit some collateral
(e.g. ETH). This deposited collateral is then used to then lend out to other
users.

Users can then borrow assets and tokens from others depending on what they
need (e.g. you might borrow MKR if you want to vote in a MakerDAO governance
proposal) up to a certain percentage of their deposited collateral. For
example, if the borrowing amount is a maximum of 30%, a user who deposits 100
DAI into the protocol can borrow up to 30 DAI worth of another asset. The
protocol determines the exact borrowing power percentage.

As the value of a borrower's collateral fluctuates, so too does their
borrowing power. If, due to market fluctuations, the value of borrowed assets
exceeds say, 30% of the value of their collateral (again, the exact percentage
is determined by the protocol), the protocol typically allows anyone to
liquidate the collateral, instantly paying off the lenders (this is similar to
how [margin calls(opens in a new
tab)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margincall.asp) work in traditional
finance). If liquidated, the borrower usually has to pay a hefty liquidation
fee, some of which goes to the liquidator — which is where the MEV opportunity
comes in.

Searchers compete to parse blockchain data as fast as possible to determine
which borrowers can be liquidated and be the first to submit a liquidation
transaction and collect the liquidation fee for themselves.

### Sandwich trading

Sandwich trading is another common method of MEV extraction.

To sandwich, a searcher will watch the mempool for large DEX trades. For
instance, suppose someone wants to buy 10,000 UNI with DAI on Uniswap. A trade
of this magnitude will have a meaningful effect on the UNI/DAI pair,
potentially significantly raising the price of UNI relative to DAI.

A searcher can calculate the approximate price effect of this large trade on
the UNI/DAI pair and execute an optimal buy order immediately _before_ the
large trade, buying UNI cheaply, then execute a sell order immediately _after_
the large trade, selling it for the higher price caused by the large order.

Sandwiching, however, is riskier as it isn't atomic (unlike DEX arbitrage, as
described above) and is prone to a [salmonella attack(opens in a new
tab)](https://github.com/Defi-Cartel/salmonella).

### NFT MEV

MEV in the NFT space is an emergent phenomenon, and isn't necessarily
profitable.

However, since NFT transactions happen on the same blockchain shared by all
other Ethereum transactions, searchers can use similar techniques as those
used in traditional MEV opportunities in the NFT market too.

For example, if there's a popular NFT drop and a searcher wants a certain NFT
or set of NFTs, they can program a transaction such that they are the first in
line to buy the NFT, or they can buy the entire set of NFTs in a single
transaction. Or if an NFT is [mistakenly listed at a low price(opens in a new
tab)](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/113546/mistake-
sees-69000-cryptopunk-sold-for-less-than-a-cent), a searcher can frontrun
other purchasers and snap it up for cheap.

One prominent example of NFT MEV occurred when a searcher spent $7 million to
[buy(opens in a new
tab)](https://etherscan.io/address/0x650dCdEB6ecF05aE3CAF30A70966E2F395d5E9E5)
every single Cryptopunk at the price floor. A blockchain researcher [explained
on Twitter(opens in a new
tab)](https://twitter.com/IvanBogatyy/status/1422232184493121538) how the
buyer worked with an MEV provider to keep their purchase secret.

### The long tail

DEX arbitrage, liquidations, and sandwich trading are all very well-known MEV
opportunities and are unlikely to be profitable for new searchers. However,
there is a long tail of lesser known MEV opportunities (NFT MEV is arguably
one such opportunity).

Searchers who are just getting started may be able to find more success by
searching for MEV in this longer tail. Flashbot's [MEV job board(opens in a
new tab)](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-job-board) lists some emerging
opportunities.

## Effects of MEV

MEV is not all bad — there are both positive and negative consequences to MEV
on Ethereum.

### The good

Many DeFi projects rely on economically rational actors to ensure the
usefulness and stability of their protocols. For instance, DEX arbitrage
ensures that users get the best, most correct prices for their tokens, and
lending protocols rely on speedy liquidations when borrowers fall below
collateralization ratios to ensure lenders get paid back.

Without rational searchers seeking and fixing economic inefficiencies and
taking advantage of protocols' economic incentives, DeFi protocols and dapps
in general may not be as robust as they are today.

### The bad

At the application layer, some forms of MEV, like sandwich trading, result in
an unequivocally worse experience for users. Users who are sandwiched face
increased slippage and worse execution on their trades.

At the network layer, generalized frontrunners and the gas-price auctions they
often engage in (when two or more frontrunners compete for their transaction
to be included in the next block by progressively raising their own
transactions' gas price) result in network congestion and high gas prices for
everyone else trying to run regular transactions.

Beyond what's happening _within_ blocks, MEV can have deleterious effects
_between_ blocks. If the MEV available in a block significantly exceeds the
standard block reward, validators may be incentivized to reorg blocks and
capture the MEV for themselves, causing blockchain re-organization and
consensus instability.

This possibility of blockchain re-organization has been [previously explored
on the Bitcoin blockchain(opens in a new
tab)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2976749.2978408). As Bitcoin's block
reward halves and transaction fees make up a greater and greater portion of
the block reward, situations arise where it becomes economically rational for
miners to give up the next block's reward and instead remine past blocks with
higher fees. With the growth of MEV, the same sort of situation could occur in
Ethereum, threatening the integrity of the blockchain.

## State of MEV

MEV extraction ballooned in early 2021, resulting in extremely high gas prices
in the first few months of the year. The emergence of Flashbots's MEV relay
has reduced the effectiveness of generalized frontrunners and has taken gas
price auctions off-chain, lowering gas prices for ordinary users.

While many searchers are still making good money from MEV, as opportunities
become more well-known and more and more searchers compete for the same
opportunity, validators will capture more and more total MEV revenue (because
the same sort of gas auctions as originally described above also occur in
Flashbots, albeit privately, and validators will capture the resulting gas
revenue). MEV is also not unique to Ethereum, and as opportunities become more
competitive on Ethereum, searchers are moving to alternate blockchains like
Binance Smart Chain, where similar MEV opportunities as those on Ethereum
exist with less competition.

On the other hand, the transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake and the
ongoing effort to scale Ethereum using rollups all change the MEV landscape in
ways that are still somewhat unclear. It is not yet well known how having
guaranteed block-proposers known slightly in advance changes the dynamics of
MEV extraction compared to the probabilistic model in proof-of-work or how
this will be disrupted when [single secret leader election(opens in a new
tab)](https://ethresear.ch/t/secret-non-single-leader-election/11789) and
[distributed validator technology](/en/staking/dvt/) get implemented.
Similarly, it remains to be seen what MEV opportunities exist when most user
activity is ported away from Ethereum and onto its layer 2 rollups and shards.

## MEV in Ethereum Proof-of-Stake (PoS)

As explained, MEV has negative implications for overall user experience and
consensus-layer security. But Ethereum’s transition to a proof-of-stake
consensus (dubbed “The Merge”) potentially introduces new MEV-related risks:

### Validator centralization

In post-Merge Ethereum, validators (having made security deposits of 32 ETH)
come to consensus on the validity of blocks added to the Beacon Chain. Since
32 ETH may be out of the reach of many, [joining a staking
pool](/en/staking/pools/) may be a more feasible option. Nevertheless, a
healthy distribution of [solo stakers](/en/staking/solo/) is ideal, as it
mitigates the centralization of validators and improves Ethereum’s security.

However, MEV extraction is believed to be capable of accelerating validator
centralization. This is partly because, as validators [earn less for proposing
blocks](/en/roadmap/merge/issuance/#how-the-merge-impacts-ETH-supply) than
miners currently do, MEV extraction may greatly [influence validator
earnings(opens in a new
tab)](https://github.com/flashbots/eth2-research/blob/main/notebooks/mev-in-
eth2/eth2-mev-calc.ipynb) after The Merge.

Larger staking pools will likely have more resources to invest in necessary
optimizations to capture MEV opportunities. The more MEV these pools extract,
the more resources they have to improve their MEV-extraction capabilities (and
increase overall revenue), essentially creating [economies of scale(opens in a
new tab)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economiesofscale.asp#).

With fewer resources at their disposal, solo stakers may be unable to profit
from MEV opportunities. This may increase the pressure on independent
validators to join powerful staking pools to boost their earnings, reducing
decentralization in Ethereum.

### Permissioned mempools

In response to sandwiching and frontrunning attacks, traders may start
conducting off-chain deals with validators for transaction privacy. Instead of
sending a potential MEV transaction to the public mempool, the trader sends it
directly to the validator, who includes it in a block and splits profits with
the trader.

“Dark pools” are a larger version of this arrangement and function as
permissioned, access-only mempools open to users willing to pay certain fees.
This trend would diminish Ethereum’s permissionlessness and trustlessness and
potentially transform the blockchain into a “pay-to-play” mechanism that
favors the highest bidder.

Permissioned mempools would also accelerate the centralization risks described
in the previous section. Large pools running multiple validators will likely
benefit from offering transaction privacy to traders and users, increasing
their MEV revenues.

Combating these MEV-related problems in post-Merge Ethereum is a core area of
research. To date, two solutions proposed to reduce the negative impact of MEV
on Ethereum’s decentralization and security after The Merge are **Proposer-
Builder Separation (PBS)** and the **Builder API**.

### Proposer-Builder Separation

In both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake, a node that builds a block proposes
it for addition to the chain to other nodes participating in consensus. A new
block becomes part of the canonical chain after another miner builds on top of
it (in PoW) or it receives attestations from the majority of validators (in
Pos).

The combination of block producer and block proposer roles is what introduces
most of the MEV-related problems described previously. For example, consensus
nodes are incentivized to trigger chain reorganizations in time-bandit attacks
to maximize MEV earnings.

[Proposer-builder separation(opens in a new
tab)](https://ethresear.ch/t/proposer-block-builder-separation-friendly-fee-
market-designs/9725) (PBS) is designed to mitigate the impact of MEV,
especially at the consensus layer. PBS’ major feature is the separation of
block producer and block proposer rules. Validators are still responsible for
proposing and voting on blocks, but a new class of specialized entities,
called **block builders** , are tasked with ordering transactions and building
blocks.

Under PBS, a block builder creates a transaction bundle and places a bid for
its inclusion in a Beacon Chain block (as the “execution payload”). The
validator selected to propose the next block then checks the different bids
and chooses the bundle with the highest fee. PBS essentially creates an
auction market, where builders negotiate with validators selling blockspace.

Current PBS designs use a [commit-reveal scheme(opens in a new
tab)](https://gitcoin.co/blog/commit-reveal-scheme-on-ethereum/) in which
builders only publish a cryptographic commitment to a block’s contents (block
header) along with their bids. After accepting the winning bid, the proposer
creates a signed block proposal that includes the block header. The block
builder is expected to publish the full block body after seeing the signed
block proposal, and it must also receive enough _attestations_ from validators
before it is finalized.

#### How does proposer-builder separation mitigate MEV’s impact?

In-protocol proposer-builder separation reduces MEV’s effect on consensus by
removing MEV extraction from the purview of validators. Instead, block
builders running specialized hardware will capture MEV opportunities going
forward.

This doesn’t exclude validators totally from MEV-related income, though, as
builders must bid high to get their blocks accepted by validators.
Nevertheless, with validators no longer directly focused on optimizing MEV
income, the threat of time-bandit attacks reduces.

Proposer-builder separation also reduces MEV’s centralization risks. For
instance, the use of a commit-reveal scheme removes the need for builders to
trust validators not to steal the MEV opportunity or expose it to other
builders. This lowers the barrier for solo stakers to benefit from MEV,
otherwise, builders would trend towards favoring large pools with off-chain
reputation and conducting off-chain deals with them.

Similarly, validators don’t have to trust builders not to withhold block
bodies or publish invalid blocks because payment is unconditional. The
validator’s fee still processes even if the proposed block is unavailable or
declared invalid by other validators. In the latter case, the block is simply
discarded, forcing the block builder to lose all transaction fees and MEV
revenue.

### Builder API

While proposer-builder separation promises to reduce the effects of MEV
extraction, implementing it requires changes to the consensus protocol.
Specifically, the [fork choice](/en/developers/docs/consensus-
mechanisms/pos/#fork-choice) rule on the Beacon Chain would need to be
updated. The [Builder API(opens in a new
tab)](https://github.com/ethereum/builder-specs) is a temporary solution aimed
at providing a working implementation of proposer-builder separation, albeit
with higher trust assumptions.

The Builder API is a modified version of the [Engine API(opens in a new
tab)](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-
apis/blob/main/src/engine/common.md) used by consensus layer clients to
request execution payloads from execution layer clients. As outlined in the
[honest validator specification(opens in a new
tab)](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-
specs/blob/dev/specs/bellatrix/validator.md), validators selected for block
proposing duties request a transaction bundle from a connected execution
client, which they include in the proposed Beacon Chain block.

The Builder API also acts as a middleware between validators and execution-
layer clients; but it is different because it allows validators on the Beacon
Chain to source blocks from external entities (instead of building a block
locally using an execution client).

Below is an overview of how the Builder API works:

  1. The Builder API connects the validator to a network of block builders running execution layer clients. Like in PBS, builders are specialized parties that invest in resource-intensive block-building and use different strategies to maximize revenue earned from MEV + priority tips.

  2. A validator (running a consensus layer client) requests execution payloads along with bids from the network of builders. Bids from builders will contain the execution payload header—a cryptographic commitment to the payload's contents—and a fee to be paid to the validator.

  3. The validator reviews the incoming bids and picks the execution payload with the highest fee. Using the Builder API, the validator creates a "blinded" Beacon block proposal that includes only their signature and the execution payload header and sends it to the builder.

  4. The builder running the Builder API is expected to respond with the full execution payload upon seeing the blinded block proposal. This allows the validator to create a "signed" Beacon block, which they propagate throughout the network.

  5. A validator using the Builder API is still expected to build a block locally in case the block builder fails to respond promptly, so they don't miss out on block proposal rewards. However, validator cannot create another block using either the now-revealed transactions or another set, as it would amount to _equivocation_ (signing two blocks within the same slot), which is a slashable offense.

An example implementation of the Builder API is [MEV Boost(opens in a new
tab)](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost), an improvement on the
[Flashbots auction mechanism(opens in a new
tab)](https://docs.flashbots.net/Flashbots-auction/overview/) designed to curb
the negative externalities of MEV on Ethereum. Flashbots auction allows miners
in proof-of-work to outsource the work of building profitable blocks to
specialized parties called **searchers**.

Searchers look for lucrative MEV opportunities and send transaction bundles to
miners along with a [sealed-price bid(opens in a new
tab)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-price_sealed-bid_auction) for
inclusion in the block. The miner running mev-geth, a forked version of the
go-ethereum (Geth) client only has to choose the bundle with the most profit
and mine it as part of the new block. To protect miners from spam and invalid
transactions, transaction bundles pass through **relayers** for validation
before getting to miners.

MEV Boost retains the same workings of the original Flashbots auction, albeit
with new features designed for Ethereum’s switch to proof-of-stake. Searchers
still find profitable MEV transactions for inclusion in blocks, but a new
class of specialized parties, called **builders** , are responsible for
aggregating transactions and bundles into blocks. A builder accepts sealed-
price bids from searchers and runs optimizations to find the most profitable
ordering.

The relayer is still responsible for validating transaction bundles before
passing them to the proposer. However, MEV Boost introduces **escrows**
responsible for providing [data availability](/en/developers/docs/data-
availability/) by storing block bodies sent by builders and block headers sent
by validators. Here, a validator connected to a relay asks for available
execution payloads and uses MEV Boost’s ordering algorithm to select the
payload header with the highest bid + MEV tips.

#### How does the Builder API mitigate MEV’s impact?

The core benefit of the Builder API is its potential to democratize access to
MEV opportunities. Using commit-reveal schemes eliminates trust assumptions
and reduces entry barriers for validators seeking to benefit from MEV. This
should reduce the pressure on solo stakers to integrate with large staking
pools in order to boost MEV profits.

Widespread implementation of the Builder API will encourage greater
competition among block builders, which increases censorship resistance. As
validators review bids from multiple builders, a builder intent on censoring
one or more user transactions must outbid all other non-censoring builders to
be successful. This dramatically increases the cost of censoring users and
discourages the practice.

Some projects, such as MEV Boost, use the Builder API as part of an overall
structure designed to provide transaction privacy to certain parties, such as
traders trying to avoid frontrunning/sandwiching attacks. This is achieved by
providing a private communication channel between users and block builders.
Unlike the permissioned mempools described earlier, this approach is
beneficial for the following reasons:

  1. The existence of multiple builders on the market makes censoring impractical, which benefits users. In contrast, the existence of centralized and trust-based dark pools would concentrate power in the hands of a few block builders and increase the possibility of censoring.

  2. The Builder API software is open-source, which allows anyone to offer block-builder services. This means users aren’t forced into using any particular block builder and improves Ethereum’s neutrality and permissionlessness. Moreover, MEV-seeking traders won’t inadvertently contribute to centralization by using private transaction channels.

### Decentralized exchange (DEX)

A type of Ethereum app that lets you swap tokens with peers on the network.
DEXes are not subject to geographical restrictions like centralized exchanges
– anyone can participate.

### Attestation

A claim made by an entity that something is true. In context of Ethereum,
consensus validators must make a claim as to what they believe the state of
the chain to be. At designated times, each validator is responsible for
publishing different attestations that formally declare this validator's view
of the chain, including the last finalized checkpoint and the current head of
the chain. [More on attestations](/en/developers/docs/consensus-
mechanisms/pos/attestations/).
