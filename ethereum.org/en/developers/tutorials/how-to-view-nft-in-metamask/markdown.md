  * Step 1: Set your network to Sepolia
  * Step 2: Add your collectable to MetaMask

This tutorial is Part 3/3 in the NFT Tutorial series, where we view our newly
minted NFT. However, you can use the general tutorial for any ERC-721 token
using MetaMask, including on Mainnet or any testnet. If you‚Äôd like to learn
how to mint your own NFT on Ethereum, you should check out [Part 1 on How to
Write & Deploy an NFT smart contract](/en/developers/tutorials/how-to-write-
and-deploy-an-nft/)!

Congrats! You‚Äôve made it to the shortest and simplest part of our NFT tutorial
series ‚Äî how to view your freshly minted NFT on a virtual wallet. We‚Äôll be
using MetaMask for this example since it is what we used in the previous two
parts.

As a prerequisite, you should already have MetaMask on mobile installed, and
it should include the account to which you minted your NFT ‚Äî you can get the
app for free on [iOS(opens in a new
tab)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/metamask-blockchain-wallet/id1438144202)
or [Android(opens in a new
tab)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.metamask&hl=en_US&gl=US).

## Step 1: Set your network to Sepolia

At the top of the app, press the ‚ÄúWallet‚Äù button, after which you‚Äôll be
prompted to select a network. As our NFT was minted on the Sepolia network,
you‚Äôll want to select Sepolia as your network.

metamask/goerliMetamask.gif)](/content/developers/tutorials/how-to-view-nft-
in-metamask/goerliMetamask.gif)

## Step 2: Add your collectable to MetaMask

Once you‚Äôre on the Sepolia network, select the ‚ÄúCollectibles‚Äù tab on the right
and add the NFT smart contract address and the ERC-721 token ID of your NFT ‚Äî
which you should be able to find on Etherscan based on the transaction hash
from your NFT deployed in Part II of our tutorial.

to-view-nft-in-metamask/findNFTEtherscan.png)

You may need to refresh a couple times to view your NFT ‚Äî but it will be there

Congrats! You have successfully minted an NFT, and you can now view it! We
can‚Äôt wait to see how you‚Äôll take the NFT world by storm!
