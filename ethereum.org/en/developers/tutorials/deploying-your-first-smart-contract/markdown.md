  * Writing our contract
  * Deploying our contract

I guess you are as excited as us to [deploy](/en/developers/docs/smart-
contracts/deploying/) and interact with your first [smart
contract](/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/) on the Ethereum blockchain.

Don‚Äôt worry, as it‚Äôs our first smart contract, we‚Äôll deploy it on a [local
test network](/en/developers/docs/networks/) so it does not cost anything for
you to deploy and play as much as you‚Äôd like with it.

## Writing our contract

First step is to [visit Remix(opens in a new
tab)](https://remix.ethereum.org/) and create a new file. On the upper left
part of the Remix interface add a new file and enter the file name you want.

[![Adding a new file in the Remix
interface](/_next/image/?url=%2Fcontent%2Fdevelopers%2Ftutorials%2Fdeploying-
your-first-smart-
contract%2Fremix.png&w=1920&q=75)](/content/developers/tutorials/deploying-
your-first-smart-contract/remix.png)

In the new file, we‚Äôll paste the following code.

    
    
    1// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
    
    2pragma solidity >=0.5.17;
    
    3
    
    4contract Counter {
    
    5
    
    6    // Public variable of type unsigned int to keep the number of counts
    
    7    uint256 public count = 0;
    
    8
    
    9    // Function that increments our counter
    
    10    function increment() public {
    
    11        count += 1;
    
    12    }
    
    13
    
    14    // Not necessary getter to get the count value
    
    15    function getCount() public view returns (uint256) {
    
    16        return count;
    
    17    }
    
    18
    
    19}
    
    Show all
    
    ![üìã](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twemoji/12.0.4/2/svg/1f4cb.svg) Copy

If you‚Äôre used to programming you can easily guess what this program does.
Here is an explainer line by line:

  * Line 4: We define a contract with the name `Counter`.
  * Line 7: Our contract stores one unsigned integer named `count` starting at 0.
  * Line 10: The first function will modify the state of the contract and `increment()` our variable `count`.
  * Line 15: The second function is just a getter to be able to read the value of the `count` variable outside of the smart contract. Note that, as we defined our `count` variable as public this is not necessary but is shown as an example.

This is all for our first simple smart contract. As you may know, it looks
like a class from OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) languages like Java or
C++. It‚Äôs now time to play with our contract.

## Deploying our contract

As we wrote our very first smart contract, we‚Äôll now deploy it to the
blockchain to be able to play with it.

[Deploying the smart contract on the blockchain](/en/developers/docs/smart-
contracts/deploying/) is actually just sending a transaction containing the
code of the compiled smart contract without specifying any recipients.

We‚Äôll first [compile the contract](/en/developers/docs/smart-
contracts/compiling/) by clicking on the compile icon on the left hand side:

[![The compile icon in the Remix
toolbar](/_next/image/?url=%2Fcontent%2Fdevelopers%2Ftutorials%2Fdeploying-
your-first-smart-contract%2Fremix-compile-
button.png&w=750&q=75)](/content/developers/tutorials/deploying-your-first-
smart-contract/remix-compile-button.png)

Then click on the compile button:

[![The compile button in the Remix solidity
compiler](/_next/image/?url=%2Fcontent%2Fdevelopers%2Ftutorials%2Fdeploying-
your-first-smart-contract%2Fremix-
compile.png&w=1080&q=75)](/content/developers/tutorials/deploying-your-first-
smart-contract/remix-compile.png)

You can choose to select the ‚ÄúAuto compile‚Äù option so the contract will always
be compiled when you save the content on the text editor.

Then navigate to the "deploy and run transactions" screen:

[![The deploy icon in the Remix
toolbar](/_next/image/?url=%2Fcontent%2Fdevelopers%2Ftutorials%2Fdeploying-
your-first-smart-contract%2Fremix-
deploy.png&w=1200&q=75)](/content/developers/tutorials/deploying-your-first-
smart-contract/remix-deploy.png)

Once you are on the "deploy and run transactions" screen, double check that
your contract name appears and click on Deploy. As you can see on the top of
the page, the current environment is ‚ÄúJavaScript VM‚Äù that means that we‚Äôll
deploy and interact with our smart contract on a local test blockchain to be
able to test faster and without any fees.

[![The deploy button in the Remix solidity
compiler](/_next/image/?url=%2Fcontent%2Fdevelopers%2Ftutorials%2Fdeploying-
your-first-smart-contract%2Fremix-deploy-
button.png&w=1920&q=75)](/content/developers/tutorials/deploying-your-first-
smart-contract/remix-deploy-button.png)

Once you've clicked the ‚ÄúDeploy‚Äù button, you‚Äôll see your contract appear on
the bottom. Click the arrow on the left to expand it so we‚Äôll see the content
of our contract. This is our variable `counter`, our `increment()` function
and the getter `getCounter()`.

If you click on the `count` or `getCount` button, it will actually retrieve
the content of the contract‚Äôs `count` variable and display it. As we did not
called the `increment` function yet, it should display 0.

[![The function button in the Remix solidity
compiler](/_next/image/?url=%2Fcontent%2Fdevelopers%2Ftutorials%2Fdeploying-
your-first-smart-contract%2Fremix-function-
button.png&w=750&q=75)](/content/developers/tutorials/deploying-your-first-
smart-contract/remix-function-button.png)

Let‚Äôs now call the `increment` function by clicking on the button. You‚Äôll see
logs of the transactions that are made appearing on the bottom of the window.
You‚Äôll see that the logs are different when you‚Äôre pressing the button to
retrieve the data instead of the `increment` button. It‚Äôs because reading data
on the blockchain does not need any transactions (writing) or fees. Because
only modifying the state of the blockchain requires to make a transaction:

[![A log of
transactions](/_next/image/?url=%2Fcontent%2Fdevelopers%2Ftutorials%2Fdeploying-
your-first-smart-contract%2Ftransaction-
log.png&w=1920&q=75)](/content/developers/tutorials/deploying-your-first-
smart-contract/transaction-log.png)

After pressing the increment button that will generate a transaction to call
our `increment()` function if we click back on the count or getCount buttons
we‚Äôll read the newly updated state of our smart contract with the count
variable being bigger than 0.

[![Newly updated state of the smart
contract](/_next/image/?url=%2Fcontent%2Fdevelopers%2Ftutorials%2Fdeploying-
your-first-smart-contract%2Fupdated-
state.png&w=750&q=75)](/content/developers/tutorials/deploying-your-first-
smart-contract/updated-state.png)

In the next tutorial, we‚Äôll cover [how you can add events to your smart
contracts](/en/developers/tutorials/logging-events-smart-contracts/). Logging
events is a convenient way to debug your smart contract and understand what is
happening while calling a function.
