So, you‚Äôve heard about this Ethereum thing and are ready to venture down the
rabbit hole? This post will quickly cover some blockchain basics, then get you
interacting with a simulated Ethereum node ‚Äì reading block data, checking
account balances, and sending transactions. Along the way, we‚Äôll highlight the
differences between traditional ways of building apps and this new
decentralized paradigm.

## (Soft) prerequisites

This post aspires to be accessible to a wide range of developers. [Python
tools](/en/developers/docs/programming-languages/python/) will be involved,
but they are just a vehicle for the ideas ‚Äì no problem if you are not a Python
developer. I will, however, be making just a few assumptions about what you
already know, so we can quickly move on the Ethereum-specific bits.

Assumptions:

  * You can get around in a terminal,
  * You've written a few lines of Python code,
  * Python version 3.6 or greater is installed on your machine (use of a [virtual environment(opens in a new tab)](https://realpython.com/effective-python-environment/#virtual-environments) is strongly encouraged), and
  * you‚Äôve used `pip`, Python‚Äôs package installer. Again, if any of these are untrue, or you don‚Äôt plan to reproduce the code in this article, you can likely still follow along just fine.

## Blockchains, briefly

There are many ways to describe Ethereum, but at its heart is a blockchain.
Blockchains are made up of a series of blocks, so let‚Äôs start there. In the
simplest terms, each block on the Ethereum blockchain is just some metadata
and a list of transactions. In JSON format, that looks something like this:

    
    
    1{
    
    2   "number": 1234567,
    
    3   "hash": "0xabc123...",
    
    4   "parentHash": "0xdef456...",
    
    5   ...,
    
    6   "transactions": [...]
    
    7}
    
    ![üìã](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twemoji/12.0.4/2/svg/1f4cb.svg) Copy

Each [block](/en/developers/docs/blocks/) has a reference to the block that
came before it; the `parentHash` is simply the hash of the previous block.

Note: Ethereum makes regular use of [hash functions(opens in a new
tab)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function) to produce fixed-size values
(‚Äúhashes‚Äù). Hashes play an important role in Ethereum, but you can safely
think of them as unique IDs for now.

[![A diagram depicting a blockchain including the data inside  each
block](/_next/image/?url=%2Fcontent%2Fdevelopers%2Ftutorials%2Fa-developers-
guide-to-ethereum-part-one%2Fblockchain-
diagram.png&w=1920&q=75)](/content/developers/tutorials/a-developers-guide-to-
ethereum-part-one/blockchain-diagram.png)

_A blockchain is essentially a linked list; each block has a reference to the
previous block._

This data structure is nothing novel, but the rules (i.e., peer-to-peer
protocols) that govern the network are. There‚Äôs no central authority; the
network of peers must collaborate to sustain the network, and compete to
decide which transactions to include in the next block. So, when you want to
send some money to a friend, you‚Äôll need to broadcast that transaction to the
network, then wait for it to be included in an upcoming block.

The only way for the blockchain to verify that money was truly sent from one
user to another is to use a currency native to (i.e., created and governed by)
that blockchain. In Ethereum, this currency is called ether, and the Ethereum
blockchain contains the only official record of account balances.

## A new paradigm

This new decentralized tech stack has spawned new developer tools. Such tools
exist in many programming languages, but we‚Äôll be looking through the Python
lens. To reiterate: even if Python isn‚Äôt your language of choice, it shouldn‚Äôt
be much trouble to follow along.

Python developers that want to interact with Ethereum are likely to reach for
[Web3.py(opens in a new tab)](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/). Web3.py is a
library that greatly simplifies the way you connect to an Ethereum node, then
send and receive data from it.

Note: ‚ÄúEthereum node‚Äù and ‚ÄúEthereum client‚Äù are used interchangeably. In
either case, it refers to the software that a participant in the Ethereum
network runs. This software can read block data, receive updates when new
blocks are added to the chain, broadcast new transactions, and more.
Technically, the client is the software, the node is the computer running the
software.

[Ethereum clients](/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/) can be configured
to be reachable by [IPC(opens in a new tab)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-
process_communication), HTTP, or Websockets, so Web3.py will need to mirror
this configuration. Web3.py refers to these connection options as
**providers**. You‚Äôll want to choose one of the three providers to link the
Web3.py instance with your node.

[![A diagram showing how web3.py uses IPC to connect your application to an
Ethereum node](/_next/image/?url=%2Fcontent%2Fdevelopers%2Ftutorials%2Fa-
developers-guide-to-ethereum-part-one%2Fweb3py-and-
nodes.png&w=1920&q=75)](/content/developers/tutorials/a-developers-guide-to-
ethereum-part-one/web3py-and-nodes.png)

_Configure the Ethereum node and Web3.py to communicate via the same protocol,
e.g., IPC in this diagram._

Once Web3.py is properly configured, you can begin to interact with the
blockchain. Here‚Äôs a couple of Web3.py usage examples as a preview of what‚Äôs
to come:

    
    
    1# read block data:
    
    2w3.eth.get_block('latest')
    
    3
    
    4# send a transaction:
    
    5w3.eth.send_transaction({'from': ..., 'to': ..., 'value': ...})
    
    ![üìã](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twemoji/12.0.4/2/svg/1f4cb.svg) Copy

## Installation

In this walkthrough, we‚Äôll just be working within a Python interpreter. We
won't be creating any directories, files, classes or functions.

Note: In the examples below, commands that begin with `$` are intended to be
run in the terminal. (Do not type the `$`, it just signifies the start of the
line.)

First, install [IPython(opens in a new tab)](https://ipython.org/) for a user-
friendly environment to explore in. IPython offers tab completion, among other
features, making it much easier to see what‚Äôs possible within Web3.py.

    
    
    pip install ipython

Web3.py is published under the name `web3`. Install it like so:

    
    
    pip install web3

One more thing ‚Äì we're going to simulate a blockchain later, which requires a
couple more dependencies. You can install those via:

    
    
    pip install 'web3[tester]'

You‚Äôre all set up to go!

Note: The `web3[tester]` package works up to Python 3.10.xx

## Spin up a sandbox

Open up a new Python environment by running `ipython` in your terminal. This
is comparable to running `python`, but comes with more bells and whistles.

    
    
    ipython

This will print out some information about the versions of Python and IPython
you‚Äôre running, then you should see a prompt waiting for input:

    
    
    1In [1]:
    
    ![üìã](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twemoji/12.0.4/2/svg/1f4cb.svg) Copy

You‚Äôre looking at an interactive Python shell now. Essentially, it's a sandbox
to play in. If you‚Äôve made it this far, it's time to import Web3.py:

    
    
    1In [1]: from web3 import Web3
    
    ![üìã](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twemoji/12.0.4/2/svg/1f4cb.svg) Copy

## Introducing the Web3 module

Besides being a gateway to Ethereum, the [Web3(opens in a new
tab)](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html#base-api) module
offers a few convenience functions. Let‚Äôs explore a couple.

In an Ethereum application, you will commonly need to convert currency
denominations. The Web3 module provides a couple of helper methods just for
this: [from_wei(opens in a new
tab)](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/web3.main.html#web3.Web3.from_wei)
and [to_wei(opens in a new
tab)](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/web3.main.html#web3.Web3.to_wei).

Note: Computers are notoriously bad at handling decimal math. To get around
this, developers often store dollar amounts in cents. For example, an item
with a price of $5.99 may be stored in the database as 599.

A similar pattern is used when handling transactions in **ether**. However,
instead of two decimal points, ether has 18! The smallest denomination of
ether is called **wei** , so that‚Äôs the value specified when sending
transactions.

1 ether = 1000000000000000000 wei

1 wei = 0.000000000000000001 ether

Try converting some values to and from wei. Note that [there are names for
many of the denominations(opens in a new
tab)](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples.html#converting-
currency-denominations) in between ether and wei. One of the better known
among them is **gwei** , as it‚Äôs often how transaction fees are represented.

    
    
    1In [2]: Web3.to_wei(1, 'ether')
    
    2Out[2]: 1000000000000000000
    
    3
    
    4In [3]: Web3.from_wei(500000000, 'gwei')
    
    5Out[3]: Decimal('0.5')
    
    ![üìã](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twemoji/12.0.4/2/svg/1f4cb.svg) Copy

Other utility methods on the Web3 module include data format converters (e.g.,
[`toHex`(opens in a new
tab)](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/web3.main.html#web3.Web3.toHex)),
address helpers (e.g., [`isAddress`(opens in a new
tab)](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/web3.main.html#web3.Web3.isAddress)),
and hash functions (e.g., [`keccak`(opens in a new
tab)](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/web3.main.html#web3.Web3.keccak)).
Many of these will be covered later in the series. To view all the available
methods and properties, utilize IPython‚Äôs auto-complete by typing `Web3`. and
hitting the tab key twice after the period.

## Talk to the chain

The convenience methods are lovely, but let‚Äôs move on to the blockchain. The
next step is to configure Web3.py to communicate with an Ethereum node. Here
we have the option to use the IPC, HTTP, or Websocket providers.

We won't be going down this path, but an example of a complete workflow using
the HTTP Provider might look something like this:

  * Download an Ethereum node, e.g., [Geth(opens in a new tab)](https://geth.ethereum.org/).
  * Start Geth in one terminal window and wait for it to sync the network. The default HTTP port is `8545`, but is configurable.
  * Tell Web3.py to connect to the node via HTTP, on `localhost:8545`. `w3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider('http://127.0.0.1:8545'))`
  * Use the `w3` instance to interact with the node.

While this is one ‚Äúreal‚Äù way to do it, the syncing process takes hours and is
unnecessary if you just want a development environment. Web3.py exposes a
fourth provider for this purpose, the **EthereumTesterProvider**. This tester
provider links to a simulated Ethereum node with relaxed permissions and fake
currency to play with.

[![A diagram showing the EthereumTesterProvider linking your web3.py
application to a simulated Ethereum
node](/_next/image/?url=%2Fcontent%2Fdevelopers%2Ftutorials%2Fa-developers-
guide-to-ethereum-part-
one%2Fethereumtesterprovider.png&w=1920&q=75)](/content/developers/tutorials/a-developers-
guide-to-ethereum-part-one/ethereumtesterprovider.png)

_The EthereumTesterProvider connects to a simulated node and is handy for
quick development environments._

That simulated node is called [eth-tester(opens in a new
tab)](https://github.com/ethereum/eth-tester) and we installed it as part of
the `pip install web3[tester]` command. Configuring Web3.py to use this tester
provider is as simple as:

    
    
    1In [4]: w3 = Web3(Web3.EthereumTesterProvider())
    
    ![üìã](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twemoji/12.0.4/2/svg/1f4cb.svg) Copy

Now you‚Äôre ready to surf the chain! That‚Äôs not a thing people say. I just made
that up. Let‚Äôs take a quick tour.

## The quick tour

First things first, a sanity check:

    
    
    1In [5]: w3.is_connected()
    
    2Out[5]: True
    
    ![üìã](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twemoji/12.0.4/2/svg/1f4cb.svg) Copy

Since we‚Äôre using the tester provider, this isn‚Äôt a very valuable test, but if
it does fail, chances are you typed something in wrong when instantiating the
`w3` variable. Double-check that you included the inner parentheses, i.e.,
`Web3.EthereumTesterProvider()`.

## Tour stop #1: [accounts](/en/developers/docs/accounts/)

As a convenience, the tester provider created some accounts and preloaded them
with test ether.

First, let‚Äôs see a list of those accounts:

    
    
    1In [6]: w3.eth.accounts
    
    2Out[6]: ['0x7E5F4552091A69125d5DfCb7b8C2659029395Bdf',
    
    3 '0x2B5AD5c4795c026514f8317c7a215E218DcCD6cF',
    
    4 '0x6813Eb9362372EEF6200f3b1dbC3f819671cBA69', ...]
    
    ![üìã](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twemoji/12.0.4/2/svg/1f4cb.svg) Copy

If you run this command, you should see a list of ten strings that begin with
`0x`. Each is a **public address** and is, in some ways, analogous to the
account number on a checking account. You would provide this address to
someone that wanted to send you ether.

As mentioned, the tester provider has preloaded each of these accounts with
some test ether. Let‚Äôs find out how much is in the first account:

    
    
    1In [7]: w3.eth.get_balance(w3.eth.accounts[0])
    
    2Out[7]: 1000000000000000000000000
    
    ![üìã](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twemoji/12.0.4/2/svg/1f4cb.svg) Copy

That‚Äôs a lot of zeros! Before you go laughing all the way to the fake bank,
recall that lesson about currency denominations from earlier. Ether values are
represented in the smallest denomination, wei. Convert that to ether:

    
    
    1In [8]: w3.from_wei(1000000000000000000000000, 'ether')
    
    2Out[8]: Decimal('1000000')
    
    ![üìã](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twemoji/12.0.4/2/svg/1f4cb.svg) Copy

One million test ether ‚Äî still not too shabby.

## Tour stop #2: block data

Let‚Äôs take a peek at the state of this simulated blockchain:

    
    
    1In [9]: w3.eth.get_block('latest')
    
    2Out[9]: AttributeDict({
    
    3   'number': 0,
    
    4   'hash': HexBytes('0x9469878...'),
    
    5   'parentHash': HexBytes('0x0000000...'),
    
    6   ...
    
    7   'transactions': []
    
    8})
    
    ![üìã](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twemoji/12.0.4/2/svg/1f4cb.svg) Copy

A lot of information gets returned about a block, but just a couple things to
point out here:

  * The block number is zero ‚Äî no matter how long ago you configured the tester provider. Unlike the real Ethereum network, which adds a new block every 12 seconds, this simulation will wait until you give it some work to do.
  * `transactions` is an empty list, for the same reason: we haven‚Äôt done anything yet. This first block is an **empty block** , just to kick off the chain.
  * Notice that the `parentHash` is just a bunch of empty bytes. This signifies that it's the first block in the chain, also known as the **genesis block**.

## Tour stop #3: [transactions](/en/developers/docs/transactions/)

We‚Äôre stuck at block zero until there‚Äôs a pending transaction, so let‚Äôs give
it one. Send a few test ether from one account to another:

    
    
    1In [10]: tx_hash = w3.eth.send_transaction({
    
    2   'from': w3.eth.accounts[0],
    
    3   'to': w3.eth.accounts[1],
    
    4   'value': w3.to_wei(3, 'ether'),
    
    5   'gas': 21000
    
    6})
    
    ![üìã](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twemoji/12.0.4/2/svg/1f4cb.svg) Copy

This is typically the point where you‚Äôd wait for several seconds for your
transaction to get included in a new block. The full process goes something
like this:

  1. Submit a transaction and hold on to the transaction hash. Until the block containing the transaction is created and broadcast, the transaction is ‚Äúpending.‚Äù `tx_hash = w3.eth.send_transaction({ ‚Ä¶ })`
  2. Wait for the transaction to be included in a block: `w3.eth.wait_for_transaction_receipt(tx_hash)`
  3. Continue application logic. To view the successful transaction: `w3.eth.get_transaction(tx_hash)`

Our simulated environment will add the transaction in a new block instantly,
so we can immediately view the transaction:

    
    
    1In [11]: w3.eth.get_transaction(tx_hash)
    
    2Out[11]: AttributeDict({
    
    3   'hash': HexBytes('0x15e9fb95dc39...'),
    
    4   'blockNumber': 1,
    
    5   'transactionIndex': 0,
    
    6   'from': '0x7E5F4552091A69125d5DfCb7b8C2659029395Bdf',
    
    7   'to': '0x2B5AD5c4795c026514f8317c7a215E218DcCD6cF',
    
    8   'value': 3000000000000000000,
    
    9   ...
    
    10})
    
    Show all
    
    ![üìã](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twemoji/12.0.4/2/svg/1f4cb.svg) Copy

You‚Äôll see some familiar details here: the `from`, `to`, and `value` fields
should match the inputs of our `send_transaction` call. The other reassuring
bit is that this transaction was included as the first transaction
(`'transactionIndex': 0`) within block number 1.

We can also easily verify the success of this transaction by checking the
balances of the two accounts involved. Three ether should have moved from one
to another.

    
    
    1In [12]: w3.eth.get_balance(w3.eth.accounts[0])
    
    2Out[12]: 999996999979000000000000
    
    3
    
    4In [13]: w3.eth.get_balance(w3.eth.accounts[1])
    
    5Out[13]: 1000003000000000000000000
    
    ![üìã](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twemoji/12.0.4/2/svg/1f4cb.svg) Copy

The latter looks good! The balance went from 1,000,000 to 1,000,003 ether. But
what happened to the first account? It appears to have lost slightly more than
three ether. Alas, nothing in life is free, and using the Ethereum public
network requires that you compensate your peers for their supporting role. A
small transaction fee was deducted from the account that submitted the
transaction - this fee is the amount of gas burned (21000 units of gas for an
ETH transfer) multiplied by a base fee that varies according to network
activity plus a tip that goes to the validator that includes the transaction
in a block.

More on [gas](/en/developers/docs/gas/#post-london)

Note: On the public network, transaction fees are variable based on network
demand and how quickly you'd like a transaction to be processed. If you're
interested in a breakdown of how fees are calculated, see my earlier post on
[how transactions are included in a block(opens in a new
tab)](https://medium.com/ethereum-grid/ethereum-101-how-are-transactions-
included-in-a-block-9ae5f491853f).

## And breathe

We‚Äôve been at this for a while, so this seems as good a place as any to take a
break. The rabbit hole continues on, and we‚Äôll continue exploring in part two
of this series. Some concepts to come: connecting to a real node, smart
contracts, and tokens. Have follow-up questions? Let me know! Your feedback
will influence where we go from here. Requests welcome via [Twitter(opens in a
