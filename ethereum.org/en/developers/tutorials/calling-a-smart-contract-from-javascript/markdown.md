  * Call: Reading value from a smart contract
  * Send: Sending a transaction to a smart contract function

In this tutorial we‚Äôll see how to call a [smart
contract](/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/) function from JavaScript.
First is reading the state of a smart contract (e.g. the balance of an ERC20
holder), then we‚Äôll modify the state of the blockchain by making a token
transfer. You should already be familiar with [setting up a JS environment to
interact with the blockchain](/en/developers/tutorials/set-up-web3js-to-use-
ethereum-in-javascript/).

For this example we‚Äôll play with the DAI token, for testing purpose we‚Äôll fork
the blockchain using ganache-cli and unlock an address that already has a lot
of DAI:

    
    
    ganache-cli -f https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/[YOUR INFURA KEY] -d -i 66 1 --unlock 0x4d10ae710Bd8D1C31bd7465c8CBC3add6F279E81

To interact with a smart contract we‚Äôll need its address and ABI:

    
    
    1const ERC20TransferABI = [
    
    2  {
    
    3    constant: false,
    
    4    inputs: [
    
    5      {
    
    6        name: "_to",
    
    7        type: "address",
    
    8      },
    
    9      {
    
    10        name: "_value",
    
    11        type: "uint256",
    
    12      },
    
    13    ],
    
    14    name: "transfer",
    
    15    outputs: [
    
    16      {
    
    17        name: "",
    
    18        type: "bool",
    
    19      },
    
    20    ],
    
    21    payable: false,
    
    22    stateMutability: "nonpayable",
    
    23    type: "function",
    
    24  },
    
    25  {
    
    26    constant: true,
    
    27    inputs: [
    
    28      {
    
    29        name: "_owner",
    
    30        type: "address",
    
    31      },
    
    32    ],
    
    33    name: "balanceOf",
    
    34    outputs: [
    
    35      {
    
    36        name: "balance",
    
    37        type: "uint256",
    
    38      },
    
    39    ],
    
    40    payable: false,
    
    41    stateMutability: "view",
    
    42    type: "function",
    
    43  },
    
    44]
    
    45
    
    46const DAI_ADDRESS = "0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f"
    
    Show all

For this project we stripped the complete ERC20 ABI to just keep the
`balanceOf` and `transfer` function but you can find [the full ERC20 ABI
here(opens in a new tab)](https://ethereumdev.io/abi-for-erc20-contract-on-
ethereum/).

We then need to instantiate our smart contract:

    
    
    1const web3 = new Web3("http://localhost:8545")
    
    2
    
    3const daiToken = new web3.eth.Contract(ERC20TransferABI, DAI_ADDRESS)
    
    ![üìã](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twemoji/12.0.4/2/svg/1f4cb.svg) Copy

We‚Äôll also set up two addresses:

  * the one who will receive the transfer and
  * the one we already unlocked that will send it:

    
    
    1const senderAddress = "0x4d10ae710Bd8D1C31bd7465c8CBC3add6F279E81"
    
    2const receiverAddress = "0x19dE91Af973F404EDF5B4c093983a7c6E3EC8ccE"
    
    ![üìã](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twemoji/12.0.4/2/svg/1f4cb.svg) Copy

In the next part we‚Äôll call the `balanceOf` function to retrieve the current
amount of tokens both addresses hold.

## Call: Reading value from a smart contract

The first example will call a ‚Äúconstant‚Äù method and execute its smart contract
method in the EVM without sending any transaction. For this we‚Äôll read the
ERC20 balance of an address. [Read our article about ERC20
tokens](/en/developers/tutorials/understand-the-erc-20-token-smart-contract/).

You can access an instantiated smart contract methods that you provided the
ABI for as follows: `yourContract.methods.methodname`. By using the `call`
function you‚Äôll receive the result of executing the function.

    
    
    1daiToken.methods.balanceOf(senderAddress).call(function (err, res) {
    
    2  if (err) {
    
    3    console.log("An error occurred", err)
    
    4    return
    
    5  }
    
    6  console.log("The balance is: ", res)
    
    7})
    
    ![üìã](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twemoji/12.0.4/2/svg/1f4cb.svg) Copy

Remember that DAI ERC20 has 18 decimals which means you need to remove 18
zeros to get the correct amount. uint256 are returned as strings as JavaScript
does not handle big numeric values. If you‚Äôre not sure [how to deal with big
numbers in JS check our tutorial about bignumber.js(opens in a new
tab)](https://ethereumdev.io/how-to-deal-with-big-numbers-in-javascript/).

## Send: Sending a transaction to a smart contract function

For the second example we‚Äôll call the transfer function of the DAI smart
contract to send 10 DAI to our second address. The transfer function accepts
two parameters: the recipient address and the amount of token to transfers:

    
    
    1daiToken.methods
    
    2  .transfer(receiverAddress, "100000000000000000000")
    
    3  .send({ from: senderAddress }, function (err, res) {
    
    4    if (err) {
    
    5      console.log("An error occurred", err)
    
    6      return
    
    7    }
    
    8    console.log("Hash of the transaction: " + res)
    
    9  })
    
    Show all
    
    ![üìã](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twemoji/12.0.4/2/svg/1f4cb.svg) Copy

The call function returns the hash of the transaction that will be mined into
the blockchain. On Ethereum, transaction hashes are predictable - that‚Äôs how
we can get the hash of the transaction before it is executed ([learn how
hashes are calculated here(opens in a new
tab)](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/45648/how-to-calculate-the-
assigned-txhash-of-a-transaction)).

As the function only submits the transaction to the blockchain, we can‚Äôt see
the result until we know when it is mined and included in the blockchain. In
the next tutorial we‚Äôll learn [how to wait for a transaction to be executed on
the blockchain by knowing its hash(opens in a new
tab)](https://ethereumdev.io/waiting-for-a-transaction-to-be-mined-on-
ethereum-with-js/).
