Follow these high-level recommendations to build more secure smart contracts.

## Design guidelines

The design of the contract should be discussed ahead of time, prior to writing
any line of code.

### Documentation and specifications

Documentation can be written at different levels, and should be updated while
implementing the contracts:

  * **A plain English description of the system** , describing what the contracts do and any assumptions on the codebase.
  * **Schema and architectural diagrams** , including the contract interactions and the state machine of the system. [Slither printers(opens in a new tab)](https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Printer-documentation) can help to generate these schemas.
  * **Thorough code documentation** , the [Natspec format(opens in a new tab)](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/natspec-format.html) can be used for Solidity.

### On-chain vs off-chain computation

  * **Keep as much code as you can off-chain.** Keep the on-chain layer small. Pre-process data with code off-chain in such a way that verification on-chain is simple. Do you need an ordered list? Sort the list offchain, then only check its order onchain.

### Upgradeability

We discussed the different upgradeability solutions in [our blogpost(opens in
a new tab)](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2018/09/05/contract-upgrade-anti-
patterns/). Make a deliberate choice to support upgradeability or not prior to
writing any code. The decision will influence how you structure your code. In
general, we recommend:

  * **Favoring[contract migration(opens in a new tab)](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2018/10/29/how-contract-migration-works/) over upgradeability.** Migration systems have many of the same advantages as upgradeable ones, without their drawbacks.
  * **Using the data separation pattern over the delegatecallproxy one.** If your project has a clear abstraction separation, upgradeability using data separation will necessitate only a few adjustments. The delegatecallproxy requires EVM expertise and is highly error-prone.
  * **Document the migration/upgrade procedure before the deployment.** If you have to react under stress without any guidelines, you will make mistakes. Write the procedure to follow ahead of time. It should include:
    * The calls that initiate the new contracts
    * Where are stored the keys and how to access them
    * How to check the deployment! Develop and test a post-deployment script.

## Implementation guidelines

**Strive for simplicity.** Always use the simplest solution that fits your
purpose. Any member of your team should be able to understand your solution.

### Function composition

The architecture of your codebase should make your code easy to review. Avoid
architectural choices that decrease the ability to reason about its
correctness.

  * **Split the logic of your system** , either through multiple contracts or by grouping similar functions together (for example, authentication, arithmetic, ...).
  * **Write small functions, with a clear purpose.** This will facilitate easier review and allow the testing of individual components.

### Inheritance

  * **Keep the inheritance manageable.** Inheritance should be used to divide the logic, however, your project should aim to minimize the depth and width of the inheritance tree.
  * **Use Slither‚Äôs[inheritance printer(opens in a new tab)](https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Printer-documentation#inheritance-graph) to check the contracts‚Äô hierarchy.** The inheritance printer will help you review the size of the hierarchy.

### Events

  * **Log all crucial operations.** Events will help to debug the contract during the development, and monitor it after deployment.

### Avoid known pitfalls

  * **Be aware of the most common security issues.** There are many online resources to learn about common issues, such as [Ethernaut CTF(opens in a new tab)](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/), [Capture the Ether(opens in a new tab)](https://capturetheether.com/), or [Not so smart contracts(opens in a new tab)](https://github.com/crytic/not-so-smart-contracts/).
  * **Be aware of the warnings sections in the[Solidity documentation(opens in a new tab)](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).** The warnings sections will inform you about non-obvious behavior of the language.

### Dependencies

  * **Use well-tested libraries.** Importing code from well-tested libraries will reduce the likelihood that you write buggy code. If you want to write an ERC20 contract, use [OpenZeppelin(opens in a new tab)](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/tree/master/contracts/token/ERC20).
  * **Use a dependency manager; avoid copy-pasting code.** If you rely on an external source, then you must keep it up-to-date with the original source.

### Testing and verification

  * **Write thorough unit-tests.** An extensive test suite is crucial to build high-quality software.
  * **Write[Slither(opens in a new tab)](https://github.com/crytic/slither), [Echidna(opens in a new tab)](https://github.com/crytic/echidna) and [Manticore(opens in a new tab)](https://github.com/trailofbits/manticore) custom checks and properties.** Automated tools will help ensure your contract is secure. Review the rest of this guide to learn how to write efficient checks and properties.
  * **Use[crytic.io(opens in a new tab)](https://crytic.io/).** Crytic integrates with GitHub, provides access to private Slither detectors, and runs custom property checks from Echidna.

### Solidity

  * **Favor Solidity 0.5 over 0.4 and 0.6.** In our opinion, Solidity 0.5 is more secure and has better built-in practices than 0.4. Solidity 0.6 has proven too unstable for production and needs time to mature.
  * **Use a stable release to compile; use the latest release to check for warnings.** Check that your code has no reported issues with the latest compiler version. However, Solidity has a fast release cycle and has a history of compiler bugs, so we do not recommend the latest version for deployment (see Slither‚Äôs [solc version recommendation(opens in a new tab)](https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Detector-Documentation#recommendation-33)).
  * **Do not use inline assembly.** Assembly requires EVM expertise. Do not write EVM code if you have not _mastered_ the yellow paper.

## Deployment guidelines

Once the contract has been developed and deployed:

  * **Monitor your contracts.** Watch the logs, and be ready to react in case of contract or wallet compromise.
  * **Add your contact info to[blockchain-security-contacts(opens in a new tab)](https://github.com/crytic/blockchain-security-contacts).** This list helps third-parties contact you if a security flaw is discovered.
  * **Secure the wallets of privileged users.** Follow our [best practices(opens in a new tab)](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2018/11/27/10-rules-for-the-secure-use-of-cryptocurrency-hardware-wallets/) if you store keys in hardware wallets.
  * **Have a response to incident plan.** Consider that your smart contracts can be compromised. Even if your contracts are free of bugs, an attacker may take control of the contract owner's keys.
