With NFTs bringing blockchain into the public eye, now is an excellent
opportunity to understand the hype yourself by publishing your own NFT
contract (ERC-721 Token) on the Ethereum blockchain!

Alchemy is extremely proud to be powering the biggest names in the NFT space,
including Makersplace (recently set a record digital artwork sale at
Christie‚Äôs for $69 Million), Dapper Labs (creators of NBA Top Shot & Crypto
Kitties), OpenSea (the world‚Äôs largest NFT marketplace), Zora, Super Rare,
NFTfi, Foundation, Enjin, Origin Protocol, Immutable, and more.

In this tutorial, we will walk through creating and deploying an ERC-721 smart
contract on the Sepolia test network using [MetaMask(opens in a new
tab)](https://metamask.io/), [Solidity(opens in a new
tab)](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.0/), [Hardhat(opens in a new
tab)](https://hardhat.org/), [Pinata(opens in a new
tab)](https://pinata.cloud/) and [Alchemy(opens in a new
tab)](https://alchemy.com/signup/eth) (don‚Äôt fret if you don‚Äôt understand what
any of this means yet ‚Äî we will explain it!).

In Part 2 of this tutorial we‚Äôll go through how we can use our smart contract
to mint an NFT, and in Part 3 we‚Äôll explain how to view your NFT on MetaMask.

And of course, if you have questions at any point, don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out
in the [Alchemy Discord(opens in a new tab)](https://discord.gg/gWuC7zB) or
visit [Alchemy's NFT API docs(opens in a new
tab)](https://docs.alchemy.com/alchemy/enhanced-apis/nft-api)!

## Step 1: Connect to the Ethereum network

There are a bunch of ways to make requests to the Ethereum blockchain, but to
make things easy, we‚Äôll use a free account on [Alchemy(opens in a new
tab)](https://alchemy.com/signup/eth), a blockchain developer platform and API
that allows us to communicate with the Ethereum chain without having to run
our own nodes.

In this tutorial, we‚Äôll also take advantage of Alchemy‚Äôs developer tools for
monitoring and analytics to understand what‚Äôs going on under the hood in our
smart contract deployment. If you don‚Äôt already have an Alchemy account, you
can sign up for free [here(opens in a new
tab)](https://alchemy.com/signup/eth).

## Step 2: Create your app (and API key)

Once you‚Äôve created an Alchemy account, you can generate an API key by
creating an app. This will allow us to make requests to the Sepolia test
network. Check out [this guide(opens in a new
tab)](https://docs.alchemyapi.io/guides/choosing-a-network) if you‚Äôre curious
to learn more about test networks.

  1. Navigate to the ‚ÄúCreate App‚Äù page in your Alchemy Dashboard by hovering over ‚ÄúApps‚Äù in the nav bar and clicking ‚ÄúCreate App‚Äù

[![Create your
app](/_next/image/?url=%2Fcontent%2Fdevelopers%2Ftutorials%2Fhow-to-write-and-
deploy-an-nft%2Fcreate-your-
app.png&w=1920&q=75)](/content/developers/tutorials/how-to-write-and-deploy-
an-nft/create-your-app.png)

  2. Name your app (we chose ‚ÄúMy First NFT!‚Äù), offer a short description, select ‚ÄúEthereum‚Äù for the Chain, and choose ‚ÄúSepolia‚Äù for your network. Since the merge the other testnets have been deprecated.

[![Configure and publish your
app](/_next/image/?url=%2Fcontent%2Fdevelopers%2Ftutorials%2Fhow-to-write-and-
deploy-an-nft%2Falchemy-explorer-
sepolia.png&w=1920&q=75)](/content/developers/tutorials/how-to-write-and-
deploy-an-nft/alchemy-explorer-sepolia.png)

  3. Click ‚ÄúCreate app‚Äù and that‚Äôs it! Your app should appear in the table below.

## Step 3: Create an Ethereum account (address)

We need an Ethereum account to send and receive transactions. For this
tutorial, we‚Äôll use MetaMask, a virtual wallet in the browser used to manage
your Ethereum account address. If you want to understand more about how
transactions on Ethereum work, check out [this
page](/en/developers/docs/transactions/) from the Ethereum foundation.

You can download and create a MetaMask account for free [here(opens in a new
tab)](https://metamask.io/download.html). When you are creating an account, or
if you already have an account, make sure to switch over to the ‚ÄúSepolia Test
Network‚Äù in the upper right (so that we‚Äôre not dealing with real money).

[![Set Sepolia as your
network](/_next/image/?url=%2Fcontent%2Fdevelopers%2Ftutorials%2Fhow-to-write-
and-deploy-an-nft%2Fmetamask-
goerli.png&w=828&q=75)](/content/developers/tutorials/how-to-write-and-deploy-
an-nft/metamask-goerli.png)

## Step 4: Add ether from a Faucet

In order to deploy our smart contract to the test network, we‚Äôll need some
fake ETH. To get ETH you can go to the [Sepolia Faucet(opens in a new
tab)](https://sepoliafaucet.com/) hosted by Alchemy, log in and enter your
account address, click ‚ÄúSend Me ETH‚Äù. You should see ETH in your MetaMask
account soon after!

## Step 5: Check your Balance

To double check our balance is there, let‚Äôs make an [eth_getBalance(opens in a
new tab)](https://docs.alchemyapi.io/alchemy/documentation/alchemy-api-
reference/json-rpc#eth_getbalance) request using [Alchemy‚Äôs composer
tool(opens in a new
tab)](https://composer.alchemyapi.io?composer_state=%7B%22network%22%3A0%2C%22methodName%22%3A%22eth_getBalance%22%2C%22paramValues%22%3A%5B%22%22%2C%22latest%22%5D%7D).
This will return the amount of ETH in our wallet. After you input your
MetaMask account address and click ‚ÄúSend Request‚Äù, you should see a response
like this:

    
    
    1`{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 0, "result": "0xde0b6b3a7640000"}`

> **Note** This result is in wei, not ETH. Wei is used as the smallest
> denomination of ether. The conversion from wei to ETH is 1 eth = 1018 wei.
> So if we convert 0xde0b6b3a7640000 to decimal we get 1*1018 wei, which
> equals 1 ETH.

Phew! Our fake money is all there.

## Step 6: Initialize our project

First, we‚Äôll need to create a folder for our project. Navigate to your command
line and type:

    
    
    1mkdir my-nft
    
    2cd my-nft

Now that we‚Äôre inside our project folder, we‚Äôll use npm init to initialize the
project. If you don‚Äôt already have npm installed, follow [these
instructions(opens in a new
tab)](https://docs.alchemyapi.io/alchemy/guides/alchemy-for-macs#1-install-
nodejs-and-npm) (we‚Äôll also need [Node.js(opens in a new
tab)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), so download that too!).

    
    
    1npm init

It doesn‚Äôt really matter how you answer the installation questions; here is
how we did it for reference:

    
    
    1package name: (my-nft)
    
    2version: (1.0.0)
    
    3description: My first NFT!
    
    4entry point: (index.js)
    
    5test command:
    
    6git repository:
    
    7keywords:
    
    8author:

    12{
    
    13  "name": "my-nft",
    
    14  "version": "1.0.0",
    
    15  "description": "My first NFT!",
    
    16  "main": "index.js",
    
    17  "scripts": {
    
    18    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
    
    19  },
    
    20  "author": "",
    
    21  "license": "ISC"
    
    22}
    
    Show all

Approve the package.json, and we‚Äôre good to go!

## Step 7: Install [Hardhat(opens in a new tab)](https://hardhat.org/getting-
started/#overview)

Hardhat is a development environment to compile, deploy, test, and debug your
Ethereum software. It helps developers when building smart contracts and dapps
locally before deploying to the live chain.

Inside our my-nft project run:

    
    
    1npm install --save-dev hardhat

Check out this page for more details on [installation instructions(opens in a
new tab)](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/#overview).

## Step 8: Create Hardhat project

Inside our project folder run:

    
    
    1npx hardhat

You should then see a welcome message and option to select what you want to
do. Select ‚Äúcreate an empty hardhat.config.js‚Äù:

    
    
    1888    888                      888 888               888

    7888    888 888  888 888    Y88b 888 888  888 888  888 Y88b.
    
    8888    888 "Y888888 888     "Y88888 888  888 "Y888888  "Y888
    
    9üë∑ Welcome to Hardhat v2.0.11 üë∑‚Äç
    
    10? What do you want to do? ‚Ä¶
    
    11Create a sample project
    
    12‚ùØ Create an empty hardhat.config.js
    
    13Quit
    
    Show all

This will generate a hardhat.config.js file for us which is where we‚Äôll
specify all of the set up for our project (on step 13).

## Step 9: Add project folders

To keep our project organized, we‚Äôll create two new folders. Navigate to the
root directory of your project in your command line and type:

    
    
    1mkdir contracts
    
    2mkdir scripts

  * contracts/ is where we‚Äôll keep our NFT smart contract code

  * scripts/ is where we‚Äôll keep scripts to deploy and interact with our smart contract

## Step 10: Write our contract

Now that our environment is set up, on to more exciting stuff: _writing our
smart contract code!_

Open up the my-nft project in your favorite editor (we like [VSCode(opens in a
new tab)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)). Smart contracts are written in a
language called Solidity which is what we will use to write our MyNFT.sol
smart contract.‚Äå

  1. Navigate to the `contracts` folder and create a new file called MyNFT.sol

  2. Below is our NFT smart contract code, which we based on the [OpenZeppelin(opens in a new tab)](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/erc721) library‚Äôs ERC-721 implementation. Copy and paste the contents below into your MyNFT.sol file.
    
        1//Contract based on [https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/erc721](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/erc721)
    
    2// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
    
    3pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
    
    4
    
    5import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";
    
    6import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Counters.sol";
    
    7import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";
    
    8import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721URIStorage.sol";
    
    9
    
    10contract MyNFT is ERC721URIStorage, Ownable {
    
    11    using Counters for Counters.Counter;
    
    12    Counters.Counter private _tokenIds;
    
    13
    
    14    constructor() ERC721("MyNFT", "NFT") {}
    
    15
    
    16    function mintNFT(address recipient, string memory tokenURI)
    
    17        public onlyOwner
    
    18        returns (uint256)
    
    19    {
    
    20        _tokenIds.increment();
    
    21
    
    22        uint256 newItemId = _tokenIds.current();
    
    23        _mint(recipient, newItemId);
    
    24        _setTokenURI(newItemId, tokenURI);
    
    25
    
    26        return newItemId;
    
    27    }
    
    28}
    
    Show all
    
    ![üìã](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twemoji/12.0.4/2/svg/1f4cb.svg) Copy

  3. Because we are inheriting classes from the OpenZeppelin contracts library, in your command line run `npm install @openzeppelin/contracts` to install the library into our folder.

So, what does this code _do_ exactly? Let‚Äôs break it down, line-by-line.

At the top of our smart contract, we import three [OpenZeppelin(opens in a new
tab)](https://openzeppelin.com/) smart contract classes:

  * @openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol contains the implementation of the ERC-721 standard, which our NFT smart contract will inherit. (To be a valid NFT, your smart contract must implement all the methods of the ERC-721 standard.) To learn more about the inherited ERC-721 functions, check out the interface definition [here(opens in a new tab)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721).

  * @openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Counters.sol provides counters that can only be incremented or decremented by one. Our smart contract uses a counter to keep track of the total number of NFTs minted and set the unique ID on our new NFT. (Each NFT minted using a smart contract must be assigned a unique ID‚Äîhere our unique ID is just determined by the total number of NFTs in existence. For example, the first NFT we mint with our smart contract has an ID of "1," our second NFT has an ID of "2," etc.)

  * @openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol sets up [access control(opens in a new tab)](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/access-control) on our smart contract, so only the owner of the smart contract (you) can mint NFTs. (Note, including access control is entirely a preference. If you'd like anyone to be able to mint an NFT using your smart contract, remove the word Ownable on line 10 and onlyOwner on line 17.)

After our import statements, we have our custom NFT smart contract, which is
surprisingly short ‚Äî it only contains a counter, a constructor, and single
function! This is thanks to our inherited OpenZeppelin contracts, which
implement most of the methods we need to create an NFT, such as `ownerOf`
which returns the owner of the NFT, and `transferFrom`, which transfers
ownership of the NFT from one account to another.

In our ERC-721 constructor, you‚Äôll notice we pass 2 strings, ‚ÄúMyNFT‚Äù and
‚ÄúNFT.‚Äù The first variable is the smart contract‚Äôs name, and the second is its
symbol. You can name each of these variables whatever you wish!

Finally, we have our function `mintNFT(address recipient, string memory
tokenURI)` that allows us to mint an NFT! You'll notice this function takes in
two variables:

  * `address recipient` specifies the address that will receive your freshly minted NFT

  * `string memory tokenURI` is a string that should resolve to a JSON document that describes the NFT's metadata. An NFT's metadata is really what brings it to life, allowing it to have configurable properties, such as a name, description, image, and other attributes. In part 2 of this tutorial, we will describe how to configure this metadata.

`mintNFT` calls some methods from the inherited ERC-721 library, and
ultimately returns a number that represents the ID of the freshly minted NFT.

## Step 11: Connect MetaMask & Alchemy to your project

Now that we‚Äôve created a MetaMask wallet, Alchemy account, and written our
smart contract, it‚Äôs time to connect the three.

Every transaction sent from your virtual wallet requires a signature using
your unique private key. To provide our program with this permission, we can
safely store our private key (and Alchemy API key) in an environment file.

To learn more about sending transactions, check out [this
tutorial](/en/developers/tutorials/sending-transactions-using-web3-and-
alchemy/) on sending transactions using web3.

First, install the dotenv package in your project directory:

    
    
    1npm install dotenv --save

Then, create a `.env` file in the root directory of our project, and add your
MetaMask private key and HTTP Alchemy API URL to it.

  * Follow [these instructions(opens in a new tab)](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-Export-an-Account-Private-Key) to export your private key from MetaMask

  * See below to get HTTP Alchemy API URL and copy it to your clipboard

[![Copy your Alchemy API URL](/content/developers/tutorials/how-to-write-and-
deploy-an-nft/copy-alchemy-api-url.gif)](/content/developers/tutorials/how-to-
write-and-deploy-an-nft/copy-alchemy-api-url.gif)

Your `.env` should now look like this:

    
    
    1API_URL="https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/your-api-key"
    
    2PRIVATE_KEY="your-metamask-private-key"

To actually connect these to our code, we‚Äôll reference these variables in our
hardhat.config.js file in step 13.

page-tutorials-env-banner

## Step 12: Install Ethers.js

Ethers.js is a library that makes it easier to interact and make requests to
Ethereum by wrapping [standard JSON-RPC
methods](/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/) with more user friendly methods.

Hardhat makes it super easy to integrate [Plugins(opens in a new
tab)](https://hardhat.org/plugins/) for additional tooling and extended
functionality. We‚Äôll be taking advantage of the [Ethers plugin(opens in a new
tab)](https://hardhat.org/plugins/nomiclabs-hardhat-ethers.html) for contract
deployment ([Ethers.js(opens in a new tab)](https://github.com/ethers-
io/ethers.js/) has some super clean contract deployment methods).

In your project directory type:

    
    
    1npm install --save-dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers@^5.0.0

We‚Äôll also require ethers in our hardhat.config.js in the next step.

## Step 13: Update hardhat.config.js

We‚Äôve added several dependencies and plugins so far, now we need to update
hardhat.config.js so that our project knows about all of them.

Update your hardhat.config.js to look like this:

    
    
    1/**
    
    2* @type import('hardhat/config').HardhatUserConfig
    
    3*/
    
    4require('dotenv').config();
    
    5require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers");
    
    6const { API_URL, PRIVATE_KEY } = process.env;
    
    7module.exports = {
    
    8   solidity: "0.8.1",
    
    9   defaultNetwork: "sepolia",
    
    10   networks: {
    
    11      hardhat: {},
    
    12      sepolia: {
    
    13         url: API_URL,
    
    14         accounts: [`0x${PRIVATE_KEY}`]
    
    15      }
    
    16   },
    
    17}
    
    Show all

## Step 14: Compile our contract

To make sure everything is working so far, let‚Äôs compile our contract. The
compile task is one of the built-in hardhat tasks.

From the command line run:

    
    
    1npx hardhat compile

You might get a warning about SPDX license identifier not provided in source
file , but no need to worry about that ‚Äî hopefully everything else looks good!
If not, you can always message in the [Alchemy discord(opens in a new
tab)](https://discord.gg/u72VCg3).

## Step 15: Write our deploy script

Now that our contract is written and our configuration file is good to go,
it‚Äôs time to write our contract deploy script.

Navigate to the `scripts/` folder and create a new file called `deploy.js`,
adding the following contents to it:

    
    
    1async function main() {
    
    2  const MyNFT = await ethers.getContractFactory("MyNFT")
    
    3
    
    4  // Start deployment, returning a promise that resolves to a contract object
    
    5  const myNFT = await MyNFT.deploy()
    
    6  await myNFT.deployed()
    
    7  console.log("Contract deployed to address:", myNFT.address)
    
    8}
    
    9
    
    10main()
    
    11  .then(() => process.exit(0))
    
    12  .catch((error) => {
    
    13    console.error(error)
    
    14    process.exit(1)
    
    15  })
    
    Show all
    
    ![üìã](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twemoji/12.0.4/2/svg/1f4cb.svg) Copy

Hardhat does an amazing job of explaining what each of these lines of code
does in their [Contracts tutorial(opens in a new
tab)](https://hardhat.org/tutorial/testing-contracts.html#writing-tests),
we‚Äôve adopted their explanations here.

    
    
    1const MyNFT = await ethers.getContractFactory("MyNFT");

A ContractFactory in ethers.js is an abstraction used to deploy new smart
contracts, so MyNFT here is a factory for instances of our NFT contract. When
using the hardhat-ethers plugin ContractFactory and Contract instances are
connected to the first signer by default.

    
    
    1const myNFT = await MyNFT.deploy();

Calling deploy() on a ContractFactory will start the deployment, and return a
Promise that resolves to a Contract. This is the object that has a method for
each of our smart contract functions.

## Step 16: Deploy our contract

We‚Äôre finally ready to deploy our smart contract! Navigate back to the root of
your project directory, and in the command line run:

    
    
    1npx hardhat --network sepolia run scripts/deploy.js

You should then see something like:

    
    
    1Contract deployed to address: 0x4C5266cCc4b3F426965d2f51b6D910325a0E7650

If we go to the [Sepolia etherscan(opens in a new
tab)](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/) and search for our contract address we
should be able to see that it has been deployed successfully. If you can't see
it immediately, please wait a while as it can take some time. The transaction
will look something like this:

The From address should match your MetaMask account address and the To address
will say ‚ÄúContract Creation.‚Äù If we click into the transaction, we‚Äôll see our
contract address in the To field:

Yasssss! You just deployed your NFT smart contract to the Ethereum (testnet)
chain!

To understand what‚Äôs going on under the hood, let‚Äôs navigate to the Explorer
tab in our [Alchemy dashboard(opens in a new
tab)](https://dashboard.alchemyapi.io/explorer). If you have multiple Alchemy
apps make sure to filter by app and select ‚ÄúMyNFT‚Äù.

[![View calls made ‚Äúunder the hood‚Äù with Alchemy‚Äôs Explorer

goerli.png&w=1920&q=75)](/content/developers/tutorials/how-to-write-and-
deploy-an-nft/alchemy-explorer-goerli.png)

Here you‚Äôll see a handful of JSON-RPC calls that Hardhat/Ethers made under the
hood for us when we called the .deploy() function. Two important ones to call
out here are [eth_sendRawTransaction](/en/developers/docs/apis/json-
rpc/#eth_sendrawtransaction), which is the request to actually write our smart
contract onto the Sepolia chain, and
[eth_getTransactionByHash](/en/developers/docs/apis/json-
rpc/#eth_gettransactionbyhash) which is a request to read information about
our transaction given the hash (a typical pattern when sending transactions).
To learn more about sending transactions, check out this tutorial on [sending
transactions using Web3](/en/developers/tutorials/sending-transactions-using-
web3-and-alchemy/).

That‚Äôs all for Part 1 of this tutorial. In [Part 2, we‚Äôll actually interact
with our smart contract by minting an NFT](/en/developers/tutorials/how-to-
mint-an-nft/), and in [Part 3 we‚Äôll show you how to view your NFT in your
Ethereum wallet](/en/developers/tutorials/how-to-view-nft-in-metamask/)!
