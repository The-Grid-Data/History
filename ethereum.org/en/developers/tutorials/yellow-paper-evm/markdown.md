[The Yellow Paper(opens in a new
tab)](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf) is the formal
specification for Ethereum. Except where amended by [the EIP
process](/en/eips/), it contains the exact description of how everything
works. It is written as a mathematical paper, which includes terminology
programmers may not find familiar. In this paper you learn how to read it, and
by extension other related mathematical papers.

## Which Yellow Paper?

Like almost everything else in Ethereum, the Yellow Paper evolves over time.
To be able to refer to a specific version, I uploaded [the current version at
writing](/content/developers/tutorials/yellow-paper-evm/yellow-paper-
berlin.pdf). The section, page, and equation numbers I use will refer to that
version. It is a good idea to have it open in a different window while reading
this document.

### Why the EVM?

The original yellow paper was written right at the start of Ethereum's
development. It describes the original proof-of-work based consensus mechanism
that was originally used to secure the network. However, Ethereum switched off
proof-of-work and started using proof-of-stake based consensus in September
2022. This tutorial will focus on the parts of the yellow paper defining the
Ethereum Virtual Machine. The EVM was unchanged by the transition to proof-of-
stake (except for the return value of the DIFFICULTY opcode).

## 9 Execution model

This section (p. 12-14) includes most of the definition of the EVM.

The term _system state_ includes everything you need to know about the system
to run it. In a typical computer, this means the memory, content of registers,
etc.

A [Turing machine(opens in a new
tab)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine) is a computational model.
Essentially, it is a simplified version of a computer, which is proved to have
the same ability to run computations that a normal computer can (everything
that a computer can calculate a Turing machine can calculate and vice versa).
This model makes it easier to prove various theorems about what is and what
isn't computable.

The term [Turing-complete(opens in a new
tab)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness) means a computer that
can run the same calculations as a Turing machine. Turing machines can get
into infinite loops, and the EVM cannot because it would run out of gas, so
it's only quasi-Turing-complete.

## 9.1 Basics

This section gives the basics of the EVM and how it compares with other
computational models.

A [stack machine(opens in a new
tab)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_machine) is a computer that stores
intermediate data not in registers, but in a [**stack**(opens in a new
tab)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_\(abstract_data_type\)). This is the
preferred architecture for virtual machines because it is easy to implement
meaning that bugs, and security vulnerabilities, are a lot less likely. The
memory in the stack is divided into 256-bit words. This was chosen because it
is convenient for Ethereum's core cryptographic operations such as Keccak-256
hashing and elliptic curve computations. The maximum size of the stack is 1024
items (1024 x 256 bits). When opcodes are executed they are usually getting
their parameters from the stack. There are opcodes specifically for
reorganizing elements in the stack such as `POP` (removes item from top of
stack), `DUP_N` (duplicated N'th item in stack), etc.

The EVM also has a volatile space called **memory** which is used to store
data during execution. This memory is organized into 32-byte words. All memory
locations are initialized to zero. If you execute this [Yul(opens in a new
tab)](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/yul.html) code to add a word to
memory, it will fill 32 bytes of memory by padding the empty space in the word
with zeros, i.e. it creates one word - with zeros in locations 0-29, 0x60 to
30, and 0xA7 to 31.

    
    
    1mstore(0, 0x60A7)

`mstore` is one of three opcodes the EVM provides for interacting with memory
- it loads a word into memory. The other two are `mstore8` which loads a
single byte into memory, and `mload` which moves a word from memory to stack.

The EVM also has a separate non-volatile **storage** model that is maintained
as part of the system state - this memory is organized into word arrays (as
opposed to word-addressable byte arrays in the stack). This storage is where
contracts keep persistent data - a contract can only interact with its own
storage. Storage is organized in key-value mappings.

Although it is not mentioned in this section of the Yellow Paper, it is also
useful to know there is a fourth type of memory. **Calldata** is byte-
addressable read-only memory used to store the value passed with the `data`
parameter of a transaction. The EVM has specific opcodes for managing
`calldata`. `calldatasize` returns the size of the data. `calldataload` loads
the data into the stack. `calldatacopy` copies the data into memory.

The standard [Von Neumann architecture(opens in a new
tab)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture) stores code and
data in the same memory. The EVM does not follow this standard for security
reasons - sharing volatile memory makes it possible to change program code.
Instead, code is saved to storage.

There are only two cases in which code is executed from memory:

  * When a contract creates another contract (using [`CREATE`(opens in a new tab)](https://www.evm.codes/#f0) or [`CREATE2`(opens in a new tab)](https://www.evm.codes/#f5)), the code for the contract constructor comes from memory.
  * During the creation of _any_ contract, the constructor code runs and then returns with the code of the actual contract, also from memory.

The term exceptional execution means an exception that causes the execution of
the current contract to halt.

## 9.2 Fees overview

This section explains how the gas fees are calculated. There are three costs:

### Opcode cost

The inherent cost of the specific opcode. To get this value, find the cost
group of the opcode in Appendix H (p. 28, under equation (327)), and find the
cost group in equation (324). This gives you a cost function, which in most
cases uses parameters from Appendix G (p. 27).

For example, the opcode [`CALLDATACOPY`(opens in a new
tab)](https://www.evm.codes/#37) is a member of group _W copy_. The opcode
cost for that group is _G verylow+Gcopy√ó‚åàŒºs[2]√∑32‚åâ_. Looking at Appendix G, we
see that both constants are 3, which gives us _3+3√ó‚åàŒº s[2]√∑32‚åâ_.

We still need to decipher the expression _‚åàŒº s[2]√∑32‚åâ_. The outmost part, _‚åà \
<value> ‚åâ_ is the ceiling function, a function that given a value returns the
smallest integer that is still not smaller than the value. For example, _‚åà2.5‚åâ
= ‚åà3‚åâ = 3_. The inner part is _Œº s[2]√∑32_. Looking at section 3 (Conventions)
on p. 3, _Œº_ is the machine state. The machine state is defined in section
9.4.1 on p. 13. According to that section, one of the machine state parameters
is _s_ for the stack. Putting it all together, it seems that _Œº s[2]_ is
location #2 in the stack. Looking at [the opcode(opens in a new
tab)](https://www.evm.codes/#37), location #2 in the stack is the size of the
data in bytes. Looking at the other opcodes in group Wcopy, [`CODECOPY`(opens
in a new tab)](https://www.evm.codes/#39) and [`RETURNDATACOPY`(opens in a new
tab)](https://www.evm.codes/#3e), they also have a size of data in the same
location. So _‚åàŒº s[2]√∑32‚åâ_ is the number of 32 byte words required to store
the data being copied. Putting everything together, the inherent cost of
[`CALLDATACOPY`(opens in a new tab)](https://www.evm.codes/#37) is 3 gas plus
3 per word of data being copied.

### Running cost

The cost of running the code we're calling.

  * In the case of [`CREATE`(opens in a new tab)](https://www.evm.codes/#f0) and [`CREATE2`(opens in a new tab)](https://www.evm.codes/#f5), the constructor for the new contract.
  * In the case of [`CALL`(opens in a new tab)](https://www.evm.codes/#f1), [`CALLCODE`(opens in a new tab)](https://www.evm.codes/#f2), [`STATICCALL`(opens in a new tab)](https://www.evm.codes/#fa), or [`DELEGATECALL`(opens in a new tab)](https://www.evm.codes/#f4), the contract we call.

### Expanding memory cost

The cost of expanding memory (if necessary).

In equation 324, this value is written as _C mem(Œºi')-Cmem(Œºi)_. Looking at
section 9.4.1 again, we see that _Œº i_ is the number of words in memory. So _Œº
i_ is the number of words in memory before the opcode and _Œº i'_ is the number
of words in memory after the opcode.

The function _C mem_ is defined in equation 326: _C mem(a) = Gmemory √ó a + ‚åäa2
√∑ 512‚åã_. _‚åäx‚åã_ is the floor function, a function that given a value returns
the largest integer that is still not larger than the value. For example,
_‚åä2.5‚åã = ‚åä2‚åã = 2._ When _a < ‚àö512_, _a 2 < 512_, and the result of the floor
function is zero. So for the first 22 words (704 bytes), the cost rises
linearly with the number of memory words required. Beyond that point _‚åäa 2 √∑
512‚åã_ is positive. When the memory required is high enough the gas cost is
proportional to the square of the amount of memory.

**Note** that these factors only influence the _inherent_ gas cost - it does
not take into account the fee market or tips to validators that determine how
much an end user is required to pay - this is just the raw cost of running a
particular operation on the EVM.

[Read more about gas](/en/developers/docs/gas/).

## 9.3 Execution environment

The execution environment is a tuple, _I_ , that includes information that
isn't part of the blockchain state or the EVM.

Parameter| Opcode to access the data| Solidity code to access the data  
---|---|---  
 _I a_| [`ADDRESS`(opens in a new tab)](https://www.evm.codes/#30)|
`address(this)`  
_I o_| [`ORIGIN`(opens in a new tab)](https://www.evm.codes/#32)| `tx.origin`  
 _I p_| [`GASPRICE`(opens in a new tab)](https://www.evm.codes/#3a)|
`tx.gasprice`  
 _I d_| [`CALLDATALOAD`(opens in a new tab)](https://www.evm.codes/#35), etc.|
`msg.data`  
 _I s_| [`CALLER`(opens in a new tab)](https://www.evm.codes/#33)|
`msg.sender`  
 _I v_| [`CALLVALUE`(opens in a new tab)](https://www.evm.codes/#34)|
`msg.value`  
 _I b_| [`CODECOPY`(opens in a new tab)](https://www.evm.codes/#39)|
`address(this).code`  
 _I H_| Block header fields, such as [`NUMBER`(opens in a new
tab)](https://www.evm.codes/#43) and [`DIFFICULTY`(opens in a new
tab)](https://www.evm.codes/#44)| `block.number`, `block.difficulty`, etc.  
_I e_| Depth of the call stack for calls between contracts (including contract
creation)|  
_I w_| Is the EVM allowed to change state, or is it running statically|  
  
A few other parameters are necessary to understand the rest of section 9:

Parameter| Defined in section| Meaning  
---|---|---  
 _œÉ_|  2 (p. 2, equation 1)| The state of the blockchain  
 _g_|  9.3 (p. 13)| Remaining gas  
 _A_|  6.1 (p. 8)| Accrued substate (changes scheduled for when the
transaction ends)  
_o_|  9.3 (p. 13)| Output - the returned result in the case of internal
transaction (when one contract calls another) and calls to view functions
(when you are just asking for information, so there is no need to wait for a
transaction)  
  
## 9.4 Execution overview

Now that have all the preliminaries, we can finally start working on how the
EVM works.

Equations 137-142 give us the initial conditions for running the EVM:

Symbol| Initial value| Meaning  
---|---|---  
 _Œº g_|  _g_|  Gas remaining  
 _Œº pc_|  _0_|  Program counter, the address of the next instruction to
execute  
 _Œº m_|  _(0, 0, ...)_|  Memory, initialized to all zeros  
 _Œº i_|  _0_|  Highest memory location used  
 _Œº s_|  _()_|  The stack, initially empty  
 _Œº o_|  _‚àÖ_|  The output, empty set until and unless we stop either with
return data ([`RETURN`(opens in a new tab)](https://www.evm.codes/#f3) or
[`REVERT`(opens in a new tab)](https://www.evm.codes/#fd)) or without it
([`STOP`(opens in a new tab)](https://www.evm.codes/#00) or
[`SELFDESTRUCT`(opens in a new tab)](https://www.evm.codes/#ff)).  
  
Equation 143 tells us there are four possible conditions at each point in time
during execution, and what to do with them:

  1. `Z(œÉ,Œº,A,I)`. Z represents a function that tests whether an operation creates an invalid state transition (see exceptional halting). If it evaluates to True, the new state is identical to the old one (except gas gets burned) because the changes have not been implemented.
  2. If the opcode being executed is [`REVERT`(opens in a new tab)](https://www.evm.codes/#fd), the new state is the same as the old state, some gas is lost.
  3. If the sequence of operations is finished, as signified by a [`RETURN`(opens in a new tab)](https://www.evm.codes/#f3)), the state is updated to the new state.
  4. If we aren't at one of the end conditions 1-3, continue running.

## 9.4.1 Machine State

This section explains the machine state in greater detail. It specifies that
_w_ is the current opcode. If _Œº pc_ is less than _||I b||_, the length of the
code, then that byte (_I b[Œºpc]_) is the opcode. Otherwise, the opcode is
defined as [`STOP`(opens in a new tab)](https://www.evm.codes/#00).

As this is a [stack machine(opens in a new
tab)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_machine), we need to keep track of
the number of items popped out (_Œ¥_) and pushed in (_Œ±_) by each opcode.

## 9.4.2 Exceptional Halting

This section defines the _Z_ function, which specifies when we have an
abnormal termination. This is a [Boolean(opens in a new
tab)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_data_type) function, so it uses
[_‚à®_ for a logical or(opens in a new
tab)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction) and [_‚àß_ for a
logical and(opens in a new
tab)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conjunction).

We have an exceptional halt if any of these conditions is true:

  * **_Œº g < C(œÉ,Œº,A,I)_** As we saw in section 9.2, _C_ is the function that specifies the gas cost. There isn't enough gas left to cover the next opcode.

  * **_Œ¥ w=‚àÖ_** If the number of items popped for an opcode is undefined, then the opcode itself is undefined.

  * **_|| Œº s || < Œ¥w_** Stack underflow, not enough items in the stack for the current opcode.

  * **_w = JUMP ‚àß Œº s[0]‚àâD(Ib)_** The opcode is [`JUMP`(opens in a new tab)](https://www.evm.codes/#56) and the address is not a [`JUMPDEST`(opens in a new tab)](https://www.evm.codes/#5b). Jumps are _only_ valid when the destination is a [`JUMPDEST`(opens in a new tab)](https://www.evm.codes/#5b).

  * **_w = JUMPI ‚àß Œº s[1]‚â†0 ‚àß Œºs[0] ‚àâ D(Ib)_** The opcode is [`JUMPI`(opens in a new tab)](https://www.evm.codes/#57), the condition is true (non zero) so the jump should happen, and the address is not a [`JUMPDEST`(opens in a new tab)](https://www.evm.codes/#5b). Jumps are _only_ valid when the destination is a [`JUMPDEST`(opens in a new tab)](https://www.evm.codes/#5b).

  * **_w = RETURNDATACOPY ‚àß Œº s[1]+Œºs[2]>|| Œºo ||_** The opcode is [`RETURNDATACOPY`(opens in a new tab)](https://www.evm.codes/#3e). In this opcode stack element _Œº s[1]_ is the offset to read from in the return data buffer, and stack element _Œº s[2]_ is the length of data. This condition occurs when you try to read beyond the end of the return data buffer. Note that there isn't a similar condition for the calldata or for the code itself. When you try to read beyond the end of those buffers you just get zeros.

  * **_|| Œº s || - Œ¥w \+ Œ±w > 1024_**

Stack overflow. If running the opcode will result in a stack of over 1024
items, abort.

  * **_¬¨I w ‚àß W(w,Œº)_** Are we running statically ([¬¨ is negation(opens in a new tab)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negation) and _I w_ is true when we are allowed to change the blockchain state)? If so, and we're trying a state changing operation, it can't happen.

The function _W(w,Œº)_ is defined later in equation 150. _W(w,Œº)_ is true if
one of these conditions is true:

    * **_w ‚àà {CREATE, CREATE2, SSTORE, SELFDESTRUCT}_** These opcodes change the state, either by creating a new contract, storing a value, or destroying the current contract.

    * **_LOG0‚â§w ‚àß w‚â§LOG4_** If we are called statically we cannot emit log entries. The log opcodes are all in the range between [`LOG0` (A0)(opens in a new tab)](https://www.evm.codes/#a0) and [`LOG4` (A4)(opens in a new tab)](https://www.evm.codes/#a4). The number after the log opcode specifies how many topics the log entry contains.

    * **_w=CALL ‚àß Œº s[2]‚â†0_** You can call another contract when you're static, but if you do you cannot transfer ETH to it.

  * **_w = SSTORE ‚àß Œº g ‚â§ Gcallstipend_** You cannot run [`SSTORE`(opens in a new tab)](https://www.evm.codes/#55) unless you have more than Gcallstipend (defined as 2300 in Appendix G) gas.

## 9.4.3 Jump Destination Validity

Here we formally define what are the [`JUMPDEST`(opens in a new
tab)](https://www.evm.codes/#5b) opcodes. We cannot just look for byte value
0x5B, because it might be inside a PUSH (and therefore data and not an
opcode).

In equation (153) we define a function, _N(i,w)_. The first parameter, _i_ ,
is the opcode's location. The second, _w_ , is the opcode itself. If
_w‚àà[PUSH1, PUSH32]_ that means the opcode is a PUSH (square brackets define a
range that includes the endpoints). If that case the next opcode is at
_i+2+(w‚àíPUSH1)_. For [`PUSH1`(opens in a new tab)](https://www.evm.codes/#60)
we need to advance by two bytes (the PUSH itself and the one byte value), for
[`PUSH2`(opens in a new tab)](https://www.evm.codes/#61) we need to advance by
three bytes because it's a two byte value, etc. All other EVM opcodes are just
one byte long, so in all other cases _N(i,w)=i+1_.

This function is used in equation (152) to define _D J(c,i)_, which is the
[set(opens in a new tab)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_\(mathematics\))
of all valid jump destinations in code _c_ , starting with opcode location
_i_. This function is defined recursively. If _i‚â•||c||_ , that means that
we're at or after the end of the code. We are not going to find any more jump
destinations, so just return the empty set.

In all other cases we look at the rest of the code by going to the next opcode
and getting the set starting from it. _c[i]_ is the current opcode, so
_N(i,c[i])_ is the location of the next opcode. _D J(c,N(i,c[i]))_ is
therefore the set of valid jump destinations that starts at the next opcode.
If the current opcode isn't a `JUMPDEST`, just return that set. If it is
`JUMPDEST`, include it in the result set and return that.

## 9.4.4 Normal halting

The halting function _H_ , can return three types of values.

  * If we aren't in a halt opcode, return _‚àÖ_ , the empty set. By convention, this value is interpreted as Boolean false.
  * If we have a halt opcode that doesn't produce output (either [`STOP`(opens in a new tab)](https://www.evm.codes/#00) or [`SELFDESTRUCT`(opens in a new tab)](https://www.evm.codes/#ff)), return a sequence of size zero bytes as the return value. Note that this is very different from the empty set. This value means that the EVM really did halt, just there's no return data to read.
  * If we have a halt opcode that does produce output (either [`RETURN`(opens in a new tab)](https://www.evm.codes/#f3) or [`REVERT`(opens in a new tab)](https://www.evm.codes/#fd)), return the sequence of bytes specified by that opcode. This sequence is taken from memory, the value at the top of the stack (_Œº s[0]_) is the first byte, and the value after it (_Œº s[1]_) is the length.

## H.2 Instruction set

Before we go to the final subsection of the EVM, 9.5, let's look at the
instructions themselves. They are defined in Appendix H.2 which starts on p.
29. Anything that is not specified as changing with that specific opcode is
expected to stay the same. Variables that do change are specified with as
\<something>‚Ä≤.

For example, let's look at the [`ADD`(opens in a new
tab)](https://www.evm.codes/#01) opcode.

Value| Mnemonic| Œ¥| Œ±| Description  
---|---|---|---|---  
0x01| ADD| 2| 1| Addition operation.  
| | | | _Œº‚Ä≤ s[0] ‚â° Œºs[0] \+ Œºs[1]_  
  
_Œ¥_ is the number of values we pop from the stack. In this case two, because
we are adding the top two values.

_Œ±_ is the number of values we push back. In this case one, the sum.

So the new stack top (_Œº‚Ä≤ s[0]_) is the sum of the old stack top (_Œº s[0]_)
and the old value below it (_Œº s[1]_).

Instead of going over all the opcodes with an "eyes glaze over list", This
article explains only those opcodes that introduce something new.

Value| Mnemonic| Œ¥| Œ±| Description  
---|---|---|---|---  
0x20| KECCAK256| 2| 1| Compute Keccak-256 hash.  
| | | | _Œº‚Ä≤ s[0] ‚â° KEC(Œºm[Œºs[0] . . . (Œºs[0] \+ Œºs[1] ‚àí 1)])_  
| | | | _Œº‚Ä≤ i ‚â° M(Œºi,Œºs[0],Œºs[1])_  
  
This is the first opcode that accesses memory (in this case, read only).
However, it might expand beyond the current limits of the memory, so we need
to update _Œº i._ We do this using the _M_ function defined in equation 328 on
p. 29.

Value| Mnemonic| Œ¥| Œ±| Description  
---|---|---|---|---  
0x31| BALANCE| 1| 1| Get balance of the given account.  
| | | | ...  
  
The address whose balance we need to find is _Œº s[0] mod 2160_. The top of the
stack is the address, but because addresses are only 160 bits, we calculate
the value [modulo(opens in a new
tab)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation) 2160.

If _œÉ[Œº s[0] mod 2160] ‚â† ‚àÖ_, it means that there is information about this
address. In that case, _œÉ[Œº s[0] mod 2160]b_ is the balance for that address.
If _œÉ[Œº s[0] mod 2160] = ‚àÖ_, it means that this address is uninitialized and
the balance is zero. You can see the list of account information fields in
section 4.1 on p. 4.

The second equation, _A' a ‚â° Aa ‚à™ {Œºs[0] mod 2160}_, is related to the
difference in cost between access to warm storage (storage that has recently
been accessed and is likely to be cached) and cold storage (storage that
hasn't been accessed and is likely to be in slower storage that is more
expensive to retrieve). _A a_ is the list of addresses previously accessed by
the transaction, which should therefore be cheaper to access, as defined in
section 6.1 on p. 8. You can read more about this subject in [EIP-2929(opens
in a new tab)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2929).

Value| Mnemonic| Œ¥| Œ±| Description  
---|---|---|---|---  
0x8F| DUP16| 16| 17| Duplicate 16th stack item.  
| | | | _Œº‚Ä≤ s[0] ‚â° Œºs[15]_  
  
Note that to use any stack item, we need to pop it, which means we also need
to pop all the stack items on top of it. In the case of [`DUP<n>`(opens in a
new tab)](https://www.evm.codes/#8f) and [`SWAP<n>`(opens in a new
tab)](https://www.evm.codes/#9f), this means having to pop and then push up to
sixteen values.

## 9.5 The execution cycle

Now that we have all the parts, we can finally understand how the execution
cycle of the EVM is documented.

Equation (155) says that given the state:

  * _œÉ_ (global blockchain state)
  * _Œº_ (EVM state)
  * _A_ (substate, changes to happen when the transaction ends)
  * _I_ (execution environment)

The new state is _(œÉ', Œº', A', I')_.

Equations (156)-(158) define the stack and the change in it due to an opcode
(_Œº s_). Equation (159) is the change in gas (_Œº g_). Equation (160) is the
change in the program counter (_Œº pc_). Finally, equations (161)-(164) specify
that the other parameters stay the same, unless explicitly changed by the
opcode.

With this the EVM is fully defined.

## Conclusion

Mathematical notation is precise and has allowed the Yellow Paper to specify
every detail of Ethereum. However, it does have some drawbacks:

  * It can only be understood by humans, which means that [compliance tests(opens in a new tab)](https://github.com/ethereum/tests) must be written manually.
  * Programmers understand computer code. They may or may not understand mathematical notation.

Maybe for these reasons, the newer [consensus layer specs(opens in a new
tab)](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-
specs/blob/dev/tests/core/pyspec/README.md) are written in Python. There are
[execution layer specs in Python(opens in a new
tab)](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-specs), but they are not complete.
Until and unless the entire Yellow Paper is also translated to Python or a
similar language, the Yellow Paper will continue in service, and it is helpful
to be able to read it.
