## Office hours for translators

We have office hours for translators on the second Wednesday of every month.
These are held in the #office-hours voice channel on the [ethereum.org
Discord(opens in a new tab)](https://ethereum.org/discord/), where you can
also find the exact times and additional details.

Office hours allow our translators to ask questions about the translation
process, provide feedback on the program, share their ideas, or just chat with
the core ethereum.org team. Finally, we want to use these calls to communicate
recent developments with the Translation Program and share key tips and
instructions with our contributors.

If you are an ethereum.org translator or would like to become one, feel free
to join us during one of these sessions.
