# Content buckets

As mentioned in our [Translation Program
overview](/en/contributing/translation-program/), we use 'content buckets'
within Crowdin to get the highest priority content released first. When you
check out a language to translate, for example, [German(opens in a new
tab)](https://crowdin.com/project/ethereum-org/de) you'll see folders for each
content bucket.
