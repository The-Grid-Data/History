## What is Ethereum?

Cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, enable anyone to transfer money globally.
Ethereum does too, but it can also run code that enables people to create apps
and organizations. Itâ€™s both resilient and flexible: any computer program can
run on Ethereum. Learn more and find out how to get started:

### What is Ethereum?

If you are new, start here to learn why Ethereum matters.

## How do I use Ethereum?

Using Ethereum can mean lots of things to lots of people. Maybe you want to
sign in to an app, prove your online identity, or transfer some ETH. The first
thing you'll need is an account. The easiest way to create and access an
account is using software called a wallet.

### What is a wallet?

Digital wallets are like real wallets; they store what you need to prove your
identity and get access to the places you value.

### Things to consider when using Ethereum

  * Each Ethereum transaction requires a fee in the form of ETH, even if you need to move different tokens built on Ethereum like the stablecoins USDC or DAI.
  * Fees can be high depending on the number of people trying to use Ethereum, so we recommend using [Layer 2s](/en/layer-2/).
