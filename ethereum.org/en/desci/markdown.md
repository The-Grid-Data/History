## What is decentralized science (DeSci)?

Decentralized science (DeSci) is a movement that aims to build public
infrastructure for funding, creating, reviewing, crediting, storing, and
disseminating scientific knowledge fairly and equitably using the _Web3_
stack.

DeSci aims to create an ecosystem where scientists are incentivized to openly
share their research and receive credit for their work while allowing anyone
to access and contribute to the research easily. DeSci works off the idea that
scientific knowledge should be accessible to everyone and that the process of
scientific research should be transparent. DeSci is creating a more
decentralized and distributed scientific research model, making it more
resistant to censorship and control by central authorities. DeSci hopes to
create an environment where new and unconventional ideas can flourish by
decentralizing access to funding, scientific tools, and communication
channels.

Decentralized science allows for more diverse funding sources (from _DAOs_ ,
[quadratic donations(opens in a new
tab)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2003531) to
crowdfunding and more), more accessible data and methods, and by providing
incentives for reproducibility.

### Juan Benet - The DeSci Movement

## How DeSci improves science

An incomplete list of key problems in science and how decentralized science
can help to address these issues

**Decentralized science**| **Traditional science**  
---|---  
Distribution of funds is **determined by the public** using mechanisms such as
quadratic donations or DAOs.| Small, closed, **centralized groups** control
the distribution of funds.  
You collaborate with peers from **all over the globe** in dynamic teams.|
Funding organizations and home institutions **limit** your collaborations.  
Funding decisions are made online and **transparently**. New funding
mechanisms are explored.| Funding decisions are made with a long turnaround
time and **limited transparency**. Few funding mechanisms exist.  
Sharing laboratory services is made easier and more transparent using _Web3_
technology.| Sharing laboratory resources is often **slow and opaque**.  
**New models for publishing** can be developed that use Web3 primitives for
trust, transparency and universal access.| You publish through established
pathways frequently acknowledged as **inefficient, biased and exploitative**.  
You can **earn tokens and reputation for peer-reviewing** work.| Your **peer-
review work is unpaid** , benefiting for-profit publishers.  
**You own the intellectual property (IP)** you generate and distribute it
according to transparent terms.| **Your home institution owns the IP** you
generate. Access to the IP is not transparent.  
**Sharing all of the research** , including the data from unsuccessful
efforts, by having all steps on-chain.| **Publication bias** means that
researchers are more likely to share experiments that had successful results.  
  
## Ethereum and DeSci

A decentralized science system will require robust security, minimal monetary
and transaction costs, and a rich ecosystem for application development.
Ethereum provides everything needed for building a decentralized science
technology.

## DeSci use cases

DeSci is building the scientific toolset to onboard traditional academia into
the digital world. Below is a sampling of use cases that Web3 can offer to the
scientific community.

### Publishing

Science publishing is famously problematic because it is managed by publishing
houses that rely upon free labor from scientists, reviewers, and editors to
generate the papers but then charge exorbitant publishing fees. The public,
who have usually indirectly paid for the work and the publication costs
through taxation, can often not access that same work without paying the
publisher again. The total fees for publishing individual science papers are
often five figures ($USD), undermining the whole concept of scientific
knowledge as a _public good_ while generating enormous profits for a small
group of publishers.

Free and open-access platforms exist in the form of pre-print servers, [such
as ArXiv(opens in a new tab)](https://arxiv.org/). However, these platforms
lack quality control, _anti-sybil mechanisms_ , and do not generally track
article-level metrics, meaning they are usually only used to publicize work
before submission to a traditional publisher. SciHub also makes published
papers free to access, but not legally, and only after the publishers have
already taken their payment and wrapped the work in strict copyright
legislation. This leaves a critical gap for accessible science papers and data
with an embedded legitimacy mechanism and incentive model. The tools for
building such a system exist in Web3.

### Reproducibility and replicability

Reproducibility and replicability are the foundations of quality scientific
discovery.

  * Reproducible results can be achieved multiple times in a row by the same team using the same methodology.
  * Replicable results can be achieved by a different group using the same experimental setup.

New Web3-native tools can ensure that reproducibility and replicability are
the basis of discovery. We can weave quality science into the technological
fabric of academia. Web3 offers the ability to create _attestations_ for each
analysis component: the raw data, the computational engine, and the
application result. The beauty of consensus systems is that when a trusted
network is created for maintaining these components, each network participant
can be responsible for reproducing the calculation and validating each result.

### Funding

The current standard model for funding science is that individuals or groups
of scientists make written applications to a funding agency. A small panel of
trusted individuals score the applications and then interview candidates
before awarding funds to a small portion of applicants. Aside from creating
bottlenecks that lead to sometimes **years of waiting** time between applying
for and receiving a grant, this model is known to be highly **vulnerable to
the biases, self-interests and politics** of the review panel.

Studies have shown that grant review panels do a poor job of selecting high-
quality proposals as the same proposals given to different panels have wildly
different outcomes. As funding has become more scarce, it has concentrated
into a smaller pool of more senior researchers with more intellectually
conservative projects. The effect has created a hyper-competitive funding
landscape, entrenching perverse incentives and stifling innovation.

Web3 has the potential to disrupt this broken funding model by experimenting
with different incentive models developed by DAOs and Web3 broadly.
[Retroactive public goods funding(opens in a new
tab)](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-
funding-33c9b7d00f0c), [quadratic funding(opens in a new
tab)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2003531), [DAO
governance(opens in a new tab)](https://www.antler.co/blog/daos-and-
web3-governance-the-promise-implications-and-challenges-ahead) and [tokenized
incentive structures(opens in a new
tab)](https://cdixon.org/2017/05/27/crypto-tokens-a-breakthrough-in-open-
network-design) are some of the Web3 tools that could revolutionize science
funding.

### IP ownership and development

Intellectual property (IP) is a big problem in traditional science: from being
stuck in universities or unused in biotechs, to being notoriously hard to
value. However, ownership of digital assets (such as scientific data or
articles) is something Web3 does exceptionally well using _non-fungible tokens
(NFTs)_.

In the same way that NFTs can pass revenue for future transactions back to the
original creator, you can establish transparent value attribution chains to
reward researchers, governing bodies (like DAOs), or even the subjects whose
data is collected.

[IP-NFTs(opens in a new tab)](https://medium.com/molecule-blog/ip-nfts-for-
researchers-a-new-biomedical-funding-paradigm-91312d8d92e6) can also function
as a key to a decentralized data repository of the research experiments being
undertaken, and plug into NFT and _DeFi_ financialization (from
fractionalization to lending pools and value appraisal). It also allows
natively on-chain entities such as DAOs like [VitaDAO(opens in a new
tab)](https://www.vitadao.com/) to conduct research directly on-chain. The
advent of non-transferable ["soulbound" tokens(opens in a new
tab)](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2022/01/26/soulbound.html) may also
play an important role in DeSci by allowing individuals to prove their
experience and credentials linked to their Ethereum address.

### Data storage, access and architecture

Scientific data can be made vastly more accessible using Web3 patterns, and
distributed storage enables research to survive cataclysmic events.

The starting point must be a system accessible by any decentralized identity
holding the proper verifiable credentials. This allows sensitive data to be
securely replicated by trusted parties, enabling redundancy and censorship
resistance, reproduction of results, and even the ability for multiple parties
to collaborate and add new data to the dataset. Confidential computing methods
like [compute-to-data(opens in a new tab)](https://7wdata.be/predictive-
analytics/compute-to-data-using-blockchain-to-decentralize-data-science-and-
ai-with-the-ocean-protocol) provide alternative access mechanisms to raw data
replication, creating Trusted Research Environments for the most sensitive
data. Trusted Research Environments have been [cited by the NHS(opens in a new
tab)](https://medium.com/weavechain/whats-in-store-for-the-future-of-
healthcare-data-b6398745fbbb) as a future-facing solution to data privacy and
collaboration by creating an ecosystem where researchers can securely work
with data on-site using standardized environments for sharing code and
practices.

Flexible Web3 data solutions support the scenarios above and provide the
foundation for truly Open Science, where researchers can create public goods
without access permissions or fees. Web3 public data solutions such as IPFS,
Arweave and Filecoin are optimized for decentralization. dClimate, for
example, provides universal access to climate and weather data, including from
weather stations and predictive climate models.

### Web3

Web3 is the new internet with blockchain, where users control their data and
transactions, not companies. No need to share any personal information. [More
on web3](/en/web3/).

### Decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)

A DAO is a digital organization run by rules coded on a blockchain, where
decisions are made by member votes, not a central authority. [More on
decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs)](/en/dao/).

### Public goods

Public goods are things everyone can use for free, like parks or clean air,
and using them doesn‚Äôt stop others from using them too. Governments often
provide these because businesses usually won‚Äôt, since they can‚Äôt easily charge
people for using them.

### Anti-Sybil

Are ways to stop people from pretending to be many users at once on the
internet, ensuring each user is a real, separate person. This helps keep
online interactions fair and honest.

### Attestation

A claim made by an entity that something is true. In context of Ethereum,
consensus validators must make a claim as to what they believe the state of
the chain to be. At designated times, each validator is responsible for
publishing different attestations that formally declare this validator's view
of the chain, including the last finalized checkpoint and the current head of
the chain. [More on attestations](/en/developers/docs/consensus-
mechanisms/pos/attestations/).
