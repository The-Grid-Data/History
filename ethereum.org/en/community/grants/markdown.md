## Quadratic funding

The open source roots of Ethereum have led to the growth of an interesting new
fundraising model: quadratic funding. This has the potential to improve the
way we fund all types of public goods in the future. Quadratic funding makes
sure that the projects that receive the most funding are those with the most
unique demand. In other words, projects that stand to improve the lives of the
most people. [More on quadratic funding.](/en/defi/#quadratic-funding)
