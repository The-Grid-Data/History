## Non-technical skillsets
![üíº](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twemoji/12.0.4/2/svg/1f4bc.svg)‚Äç

If you‚Äôre not a developer, it can be hard to know where to start in Ethereum.
Here are a few suggestions, along with resources for specific professional
backgrounds.

### Organize a meetup in your city

  * Not sure how to start? The [BUIDL network(opens in a new tab)](https://consensys.net/developers/buidlnetwork/) can help.

### Write content about Ethereum

  * Ethereum needs good writers who can explain its value in plain language
  * Not ready to publish your own articles? Consider contributing to the existing content on community resources, or [propose new content for ethereum.org](/en/contributing/)!

### Offer to take notes for community calls

  * There are many open-source community calls, and having notetakers is a huge help. If you‚Äôre interested, join the [Ethereum Cat Herders discord(opens in a new tab)](https://discord.com/invite/Nz6rtfJ8Cu), and introduce yourself!

### Translate Ethereum content into your native language

  * ethereum.org maintains a Translation Program that translates the website, and other resources, into many different languages
  * Find out how to get involved [here](/en/contributing/translation-program/)

### Run a node

Join thousands of node operators in helping to further decentralize Ethereum.

  * [More on how to run a node](/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/run-a-node/)

### Stake your ETH

By staking your ETH you can earn rewards whilst helping to secure the Ethereum
network.

  * [More on staking](/en/staking/)

### Support projects

The Ethereum ecosystem is on a mission to fund public goods and impactful
projects. With very small donations you can show your support and allow
important work to be realized.

  * [clr.fund(opens in a new tab)](https://clr.fund/#/about)

## Financial professionals & Accountants
![üìà](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twemoji/12.0.4/2/svg/1f4c8.svg)‚Äç

  * Ethereum is home to the ‚ÄúDecentralized Finance‚Äù ecosystem - a network of protocols and applications that offer an alternative financial system. If you‚Äôre a financial professional, check out some DeFi apps at [DeFi Llama(opens in a new tab)](https://defillama.com/) or [DeFiPrime(opens in a new tab)](https://defiprime.com)
  * Accountant? Assets on Ethereum - ETH, tokens, DeFi, etc - introduce many novel accounting issues. You could start by checking out some projects that aim to help users of cryptocurrency solve their bookkeeping & accounting challenges, like [Rotki(opens in a new tab)](https://rotki.com/)

## Product Managers üñã‚Äç

  * The Ethereum ecosystem needs your talents! Many companies are hiring for product manager roles. If you want to start by contributing to an open source project, get in touch with the [Ethereum Cat Herders(opens in a new tab)](https://discord.com/invite/Nz6rtfJ8Cu) or [RaidGuild(opens in a new tab)](https://www.raidguild.org/)

## Marketing
![üì£](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twemoji/12.0.4/2/svg/1f4e3.svg)‚Äç

## Join a DAO

"DAOs" are decentralized autonomous organizations. These groups leverage
Ethereum technology to facilitate organization and collaboration. For
instance, for controlling membership, voting on proposals, or managing pooled
assets. While DAOs are still experimental, they offer opportunities for you to
find groups that you identify with, find collaborators, and grow your impact
on the Ethereum community. [More on DAOs](/en/dao/)
