# Language resources

The Ethereum community is global and comprised of millions of non-English
speakers.

Our aim is to provide educational content in all languages and help overcome
the language barriers that make onboarding people from all over the world to
Ethereum a challenge.

If you prefer reading in your native language or know someone who doesn’t
speak English, you can find a list of useful non-English resources below.
Hundreds of thousands of Ethereum enthusiasts gather in these online forums to
share news, talk about recent developments, debate technical issues, and
imagine the future.

Know of an educational resource in your language? [Open an issue(opens in a
new tab)](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website/issues/new/choose)
to add it to the list!

## Ethereum.org resources

Ethereum.org is natively translated into over 40 languages which you can find
using our languages selector menu, located at the top of every page.

[![Language selector

resources%2Flanguage-selector-
menu.png&w=1920&q=75)](/content/community/language-resources/language-
selector-menu.png)

If you are bilingual and want to help us reach more people, you can also get
involved with the [ethereum.org Translation
Program](/en/contributing/translation-program/#translation-program) and help
us translate the website.
