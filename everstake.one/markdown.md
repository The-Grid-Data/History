## Media about Everstake

“Everstake, has been in the validation business for almost five years. And
while our revenue model heavily relies on incentivizing people to stake their
crypto, seeing that some of them don’t really understand what staking is has
always been quite disheartening for me.”

“Cryptocurrency has been the best way for Ukrainians to donate since the
government instituted martial law on Feb. 24, limiting their ability to send
or receive funds, said Sergey Vasylchuk, chief executive of Kyiv-based crypto
firm Everstake.”

“Ukraine has launched a crypto donations website. The initiative, dubbed Aid
for Ukraine, is a collaboration between staking service Everstake and
Ukraine.”

“As far as I can see from other cryptocurrency businesses, first, they lay off
those overpaid and then those who are paid little but do even less. Middle
developers are a much rarer victim of layoffs.”

“In crypto, I must say everyone should have expected a bear market to come
upon us. Sooner or later, it would happen, inevitable as winter. Those who
were euphoric during the bull run and weren’t preparing paid a huge price for
having their heads in the clouds.”

“Aid for Ukraine, which has the backing of staking platform Everstake and
Ukraine’s Kuna exchange, will route donated crypto to the National Bank of
Ukraine. Ukraine’s crypto-savvy Ministry of Digital Transformation is also
involved.”

“Mykhailo Fedorov teamed up with Ukrainian blockchain company Everstake to
release a video seeking additional crypto donations from the world. The video
titled “Invest In Peace Bro.”
