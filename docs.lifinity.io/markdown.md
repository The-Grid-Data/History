# What is Lifinity?

Lifinity is the first proactive market maker on Solana designed to improve
capital efficiency and reduce impermanent loss.

Lifinity's DEX innovations:

  * Concentrated liquidity combined with lazy liquidity provision; no need to adjust positions

  * Reduces or even reverses impermanent loss by using an oracle as the main pricing mechanism

  * Generates a profit from market making through delayed rebalancing of pools

Lifinity's tokenomics innovations:

  * The protocol continuously acquires liquidity for all token pairs the DEX provides liquidity for

  * Improved veToken model with optional decaying, linear unlocking, and native tokenization

  * Token launch via a veIDO

Lifinity also has a collection of NFTs called Flares:

  * 10,000 animated NFTs

  * All Flare sale proceeds were deposited into Lifinityâ€™s liquidity pools

  * All revenue from trading fees and royalties are used for buybacks and reinvestment

  * If Flares fall below 50% of their mint price, they are bought back with the pooled funds

  * 1% of the LFNTY token supply was distributed to Flare holders

Our documentation explains the _what_ of our protocol without getting into the
_why_. To get the full picture, we recommend reading our [litepaper,

series](https://medium.com/@lifinity.io/lifinity-tokenomics-series-
part-1-liquidity-mining-and-protocol-owned-liquidity-a7dade99ecf4), and
[Flares article](https://medium.com/@lifinity.io/lifinity-flares-a-merging-of-
defi-nfts-1355e4c99416).
