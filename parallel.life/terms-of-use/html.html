blockchain collectibles (collectively, the “App”). 12783185 Canada Inc. dba Parallel ("Parallel”, "we", or "us") either directly or by way of one of its licensees, is making the App available to you. The App provides users with the opportunity to purchase, collect and showcase digital blockchain collectibles in the form of CARDS (each, a “CARD”), and collect, earn and redeem digital tokens, rewards or credits (each, a "PRIME"). Each CARD and PRIME is an ERC-20 compatible token (a "Token") on the Ethereum Network. Before you use the App, however, you will need to agree to these Terms of Use and any terms and conditions incorporated herein by reference (collectively, these “Terms").</p><p>These Terms require the use of arbitration to resolve disputes, rather than recourse to the judicial system.</p><p>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE APP. THESE TERMS GOVERN YOUR USE OF THE APP, UNLESS WE HAVE EXECUTED A SEPARATE WRITTEN AGREEMENT WITH YOU FOR THAT PURPOSE. WE ARE ONLY WILLING TO MAKE THE APP AVAILABLE TO YOU IF YOU ACCEPT ALL OF THESE TERMS. BY USING THE APP OR ANY PART OF IT, OR BY CLICKING “I ACCEPT” BELOW OR INDICATING YOUR ACCEPTANCE IN AN ADJOINING BOX, YOU ARE CONFIRMING THAT YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ALL OF THESE TERMS. IF YOU ARE ACCEPTING THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL AUTHORITY TO ACCEPT THESE TERMS ON THAT ENTITY'S BEHALF, IN WHICH CASE “YOU” WILL MEAN THAT ENTITY. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY, OR IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT ALL OF THESE TERMS, THEN WE ARE UNWILLING TO MAKE THE APP AVAILABLE TO YOU. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE APP.</p><p>THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS AN ARBITRATION PROVISION (SEE SECTION 16). PLEASE REVIEW THE ARBITRATION PROVISION CAREFULLY, SINCE IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS. BY USING THE APP OR ANY PART OF IT, OR BY CLICKING “I ACCEPT” BELOW OR INDICATING YOUR ACCEPTANCE IN AN ADJOINING BOX, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE ARBITRATION PROVISION.</p><p>ANY PURCHASE OR SALE YOU MAKE, ACCEPT OR FACILITATE OUTSIDE OF THIS APP OF A CARD OR PRIME (WHERE APPLICABLE) WILL BE ENTIRELY AT YOUR RISK. WE DO NOT CONTROL OR ENDORSE PURCHASES OR SALES OF CARDS OR PRIME OUTSIDE OF THIS APP. WE EXPRESSLY DENY ANY OBLIGATION TO INDEMNIFY YOU OR HOLD YOU HARMLESS FOR ANY LOSSES YOU MAY INCUR BY TRANSACTING, OR FACILITATING TRANSACTIONS, IN CARDS OR PRIME OUTSIDE OF THIS APP.</p><p>This document contains very important information regarding your rights and obligations, as well as conditions, limitations and exclusions that might apply to you. Please read it carefully.</p><p>BY USING THE APP OR ANY PART OF IT, OR BY CLICKING “I ACCEPT” BELOW OR INDICATING YOUR ACCEPTANCE IN AN ADJOINING BOX, YOU ARE CONFIRMING THAT YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ALL OF THESE TERMS.</p><p>Any changes to these Terms will be in effect as of the “Last Updated Date” referred to at the top of this page. You should review these Terms before using the App or purchasing any product or using any services that are available through this App. Your continued use of this App after the “Last Updated Date” will constitute your acceptance of and agreement to such changes.</p><p>By using this App, you affirm that you are of legal age to enter into these Terms, and you accept and are bound by these Terns. You affirm that if you are using this App on behalf of an organization or company, you have the legal authority to bind any such organization or company to these Terms.</p><p>You may not use this App if you: (i) do not agree to these Terms; (ii) are not of the age of majority in your jurisdiction of residence; or (iii) are prohibited from accessing or using this App or any of this App’s contents, products or services by applicable law.</p><p>1. USE OF THE APP; ACCOUNT SET-UP AND SECURITY</p><p>● Account and Wallet Set-Up. To most easily use the App, you should first install a web browser (such as Google Chrome). You will also need to use a digital wallet (such as MetaMask™ or other supported electronic wallets), which will enable you to purchase and store collectibles that you collect or purchase. Each collectible is a Token.</p><p>● Account Registration. You must provide accurate and complete registration information when you create an account for the App. By creating an account, you agree to provide accurate, current and complete account information about yourself, and to maintain and promptly update your account information as necessary. We reserve the right reclaim usernames without liability to you.</p><p>● Account Security. You are responsible for the security of your account for the App and for your digital wallets. If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your password or of your account with us, you agree to notify us immediately at info@parallelnft.com.</p><p>● Account Transactions. You can use your digital wallet to purchase, store, and engage in transactions, or via one or more cryptocurrencies that we may elect to accept from time to time. Transactions that take place on the App are managed and confirmed via the Ethereum Blockchain Network. You understand that your Ethereum Network public address will be made publicly visible whenever you engage in a transaction on the App.</p><p> 2. PURCHASING AND EARNING YOUR CARDS</p><p>● Acquiring Collectible Cards. The App allows you to purchase, earn, collect and showcase CARDS (each, a “CARD”). Each CARD is a Token on the Ethereum Network.<!-- --> </p><p>● Purchasing CARDS. You can purchase CARDS in two ways: </p><p>● by buying individual or packs of CARDS on the App (each, a “Pack”) from Echelon Prime Inc., a company located in the British Virgin Islands to whom Parallel has licensed the App; or<!-- --> </p><p>● by buying CARDS from other users in a 3rd party digital marketplace.</p><p>There are different types of Packs available for purchase on the App, and we reserve the right to modify the types, prices and numbers of Packs or individual CARDS available at our discretion. Depending on the type of Pack you buy, you will collect CARDS of varying levels of scarcity. Before you buy a Pack, we will let you know the types of CARDS (but not the exact CARDS) that are contained in that Pack. If you buy an individual CARD from another user in the Marketplace, you will know the exact CARD that you are purchasing. We strongly encourage you not to purchase CARDS other than in Packs or on the Marketplace. If you decide to purchase CARDS in any other way, you understand that such purchases will be entirely at your sole risk.<!-- --> </p><p>● Earning CARDS. You can earn CARDS from Parallel for free by participating in certain challenges or marketing campaigns on the App, or by completing certain in-App tasks that Parallel may make generally available from time to time.<!-- --> </p><p>● Characteristics of CARDS. CARDS are comprised of a digitally generated 3D model of a character or 3D model of artifacts rendered by an artist, and a set of statistics that are associated with one or more characters. Each CARD has a defined set of attributes – including scarcity – which help determine the value of the CARD.<!-- --> </p><p>● Subjectivity of CARDS. The value of each CARD is inherently subjective, in the same way the value of other collectibles is inherently subjective. Each CARD has no inherent or intrinsic value. Some collectors might prefer to have a CARD featuring a 3D model of a character, while another might prefer an equivalent CARD featuring 3D model of an object.</p><p>● PARALLEL MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WRITTEN OR ORAL, IN CONNECTION WITH THE PRICE OR VALUE OF ANY CARDS SOLD, PURCHASED, TRANSFERRED OR OTHERWISE TRANSACTED BY WAY OF THE APP, INCLUDING THAT THE PRICE OR VALUE IS FAIR OR ACCURATE.</p><p>3. EARNING AND REDEEMING PRIME</p><p>● PRIME. Parallel may make available to you the opportunity to earn, redeem or otherwise acquire PRIME for use on the App or with other products and services of Parallel (as applicable), but shall have no obligation to do so. Each PRIME is a Token on the Ethereum Network.</p><p>● Earning PRIME. PRIME can be received or acquired by interacting with web experiences associated with the App or other Parallel products and services, or using the App or other Parallel products and services, including playing Parallel TCG.</p><p>● Ownership of PRIME. PRIME is wholly owned by Echelon Prime Foundation Silverside Management Ltd., a company located in the Cayman Islands who has licensed use and distribution of PRIME to you. Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Section 3, Parallel and/or its licensors reserves all rights in the PRIME; and although you may benefit from a licence to use and acquire the PRIME, you do not obtain any ownership rights in respect of PRIME.</p><p>● License to PRIME. When you acquire access to PRIME, Parallel grants to you a licence to use PRIME, subject to the limitations and prohibitions in this Section 3 or otherwise as set out in these Terms.</p><p>● No Monetary Value. You acknowledge and agree that PRIME has no inherent or intrinsic value, nor does it have any monetary, cash or currency value, and are not redeemable for money or value, except to the extent required by applicable law.</p><p>● You acknowledge that Parallel may:</p><p>(a) vary the in-App value or denomination of PRIME or may otherwise take actions that affect the utility of PRIME;</p><p>(b) impose limits upon the amounts of PRIME you may acquire; and</p><p>(c) enhance, modify, substitute, terminate, cancel, retire or suspend PRIME and/or your access to or ability to use or redeem PRIME,</p><p>in each case in Parallel's sole discretion and except to the extent prohibited by applicable law.</p><p>● Upon the termination of these Terms, any and all of your rights in relation to PRIME shall immediately and automatically terminate.</p><p>● For the avoidance of doubt, Parallel reserves the right to use technical measures to enforce the provisions of this Section 3, to the extent it is able to do so and without notice, penalty or liability to you.</p><p>● FOR GREATER CERTAINTY, PARALLEL MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WRITTEN OR ORAL, IN CONNECTION WITH THE PRICE OR VALUE OF ANY PRIME SOLD, PURCHASED, TRANSFERRED OR OTHERWISE TRANSACTED BY WAY OF THE APP, INCLUDING THAT THE PRICE OR VALUE IS FAIR OR ACCURATE.</p><p>4. PAYMENT, GAS FEES, AND TAXES</p><p>● Financial Transactions on App. Any payments or financial transactions that you engage in via the App will be conducted solely through the Ethereum Network. We have no control over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any payments or transactions. We have no liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any payments or transactions that you engage in via the App, or any other payment or transactions that you conduct via the Ethereum Network. We do not provide refunds for any purchases that you might make on or through the App – whether for CARDS, Packs, PRIME (where applicable) or anything else.</p><p>● Gas Fees. Every transaction on the Ethereum Network requires the payment of a transaction fee (each, a “Gas Fee”). The Gas Fees fund the network of computers that run the decentralized Ethereum Network. This means that you will need to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction that you instigate via the App. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in these Terms, you will be solely responsible to pay any Gas Fee for any transaction that you instigate via the App.</p><p>● Responsibility for Taxes. You will be solely responsible to pay any and all sales, use, value-added and other taxes, duties, and assessments (except taxes on our net income) now or hereafter claimed or imposed by any governmental authority (collectively, the “Taxes”) associated with your use of the App. Except for income taxes levied on us, you: (a) will pay or reimburse us for all national, federal, state, local or other taxes and assessments of any jurisdiction, including value added taxes and taxes as required by international tax treaties, customs or other import or export taxes, and amounts levied in lieu thereof based on charges set, services performed or payments made hereunder, as are now or hereafter may be imposed under the authority of any national, state, local or any other taxing jurisdiction; and (b) will not be entitled to deduct the amount of any such taxes, duties or assessments from payments (including Gas Fees) made to us pursuant to these Terms. To allow us to determine our tax obligations, unless you otherwise notify us in writing, you confirm that you are not a resident in Canada nor are you registered for Goods and services tax / Harmonized sales tax (GST / HST) or Provincial sales taxes (PST) in Canada, and will inform us if your status changes in the future.</p><p id="terms-referral-rewards">5. REFERRAL PROGRAM</p><ul><li>● <i>Referral Program. </i><span>In exchange for inviting or referring your friends to join and use the App, you may receive referral credits through your referred friends completing certain actions in the Parallel universe that can be used to redeem various rewards on the App or other products and services of Parallel (the “Referral Program”).</span></li></ul><ul><li>● <i>Membership. </i><span>Membership in the Referral Program is limited to individuals with a valid Parallel Account and is limited to one account per individual. No purchase is necessary to become a member and Parallel Account holders can join the Referral Program at any time. Once you become a member, you will be considered a “Referral Partner” of Parallel.</span></li></ul><ul><li>● <i>Referring Friends. </i><span>Once you become a Referral Partner, you will receive a code (“Referral Code”) as well as an attribution link you can include in your Content. If a User clicks on your link or enters your Referral Code using any device that has signed into that User's Parallel Account, that User will become an “Attributed User.” Each Attributed User that creates a Parallel Account will get 200 Referral Credits after they sign up through use of your Referral Code.</span></li></ul><ul><li>● <i>Earning Referral Credits. </i><span>You will earn credits when an Attributed User completes certain actions using their Parallel Account (“Referral Credits”), including as set out below:</span><table class="my-4 border"><thead><tr><th class="px-2 py-1">Action</th><th class="px-2 py-1">Credits</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="px-2">Complete a daily mission</td><td class="px-2">25</td></tr><tr><td class="px-2">Complete a weekly challenge</td><td class="px-2">75</td></tr><tr><td class="px-2">Purchase a premium battlepass</td><td class="px-2">500</td></tr></tbody></table><p>From time to time, we may offer other ways to earn Referral Credits, including through hitting certain achievements or participating in promotional programs, but we are under no obligation to do so. Referral Credits accrued are non-transferable to other members or accounts and have no cash or monetary value.</p></li></ul><ul><li>● <i>Redemption. </i><span>Referral Credits gained by you through the Referral Program can be used to redeem gift cards or specific products posted on parallel.life/referral-portal. A redeemed product will be provided digitally and/or in the form of a e-gift card, with a value equivalent to the cost of the product as of the redemption date. Referral Credits cannot be redeemed in conjunction with any other discount code or deal. You can commence the redemption process by going to the referral portal and clicking “redeem” on a reward that you have enough Referral Credits for.</span></li></ul><ul><li>● <i>Expiration of Referral Credits. </i><span>The accumulated Referral Credits in your Referral Program account will expire if your User account has neither earned nor redeemed any Referral Credits in the previous 10 years. In the event our Referral Program terminates, members will no longer be able to earn Referral Credits but will have 10 years from the effective date of termination to use any accumulated Referral Credits, after which time the Referral Credits will automatically expire. If your membership or rights to use the App or your Parallel account is cancelled, revoked or otherwise terminated, any Referral Credits in your account will expire upon the effective date of account termination.</span></li></ul><ul><li>● <b class="font-semibold">Right to Terminate. </b><span>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we reserve the right to terminate the Referral Program or modify, alter, limit or otherwise change the Referral Program at any time, including changes to benefits, membership eligibility and the structure and credits system. Any such modification, alternation or change will be communicated to you in accordance with these Terms. We reserve the right to exclude individuals from the Referral Program for any reason whatsoever at Parallel’s sole discretion, including for any abuse of the Referral Program, failure to follow any of these Terms of Use, misrepresentation or any conduct detrimental to the proper functioning of the Referral Program.</span></li></ul><p>6. OWNERSHIP, LICENSE, AND OWNERSHIP RESTRICTIONS</p><p>YOUR OWNERSHIP OF CARDS OR PRIME WILL ONLY BE RECOGNIZED BY US IF YOU HAVE PURCHASED OR OTHERWISE RIGHTFULLY ACQUIRED SUCH CARDS OR PRIME FROM A LEGITIMATE SOURCE AND NOT THROUGH ANY OF THE CATEGORY B PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES (AS DEFINED BELOW).</p><p>For the purposes of this Section 5, the following capitalized terms will have the following meanings:<!-- --> </p><p>“Art” means any art, design, and drawings (in any form or media, including, without limitation, 3D models, video or photographs, digital or print comics, books, magazine and blogs, merchandising (toys and clothing), mobile apps, and video games) that may be associated with a CARD that you Own or otherwise as provided for on the App.</p><p>"Earned PRIME" means PRIME that you Own.</p><p>“Own” means, with respect to a CARD, a CARD that you have purchased or otherwise rightfully acquired from a legitimate source (and not through any of the Category B Prohibited Activities (as defined below)), where proof of such purchase is recorded on the Ethereum Network, and with respect to PRIME, PRIME that you have earned, received or rightfully acquired by way of a license from a legitimate source (and not through any of the Category B Prohibited Activities (as defined below), where proof of such acquisition is recorded on the Ethereum Network.</p><p>“Purchased CARD” means a CARD that you Own. </p><p>"Third Party IP” means any third party patent rights (including, without limitation, patent applications and disclosures), copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, know-how or any other intellectual property rights recognized in any country or jurisdiction in the world.</p><p>● Ownership of CARD. Because each CARD is a Token on the Ethereum Network, when you purchase a CARD in accordance with these Terms (and not through any of the Category B Prohibited Activities), you own the underlying Token completely. This means that you have the right to swap your CARD, sell it, or give it away. Ownership of the CARD is mediated entirely by the Ethereum Network. Except as otherwise permitted by these Terms in cases where we determine that the CARD has not been rightfully acquired from a legitimate source (including, without limitation, through any of the Category B Prohibited Activities), at no point will we seize, freeze, or otherwise modify the ownership of any CARD.<!-- --> </p><p>● Ownership of PRIME. Unlike a CARD, PRIME is not owned by you and is credit that you can use, transfer or redeem through use of the App or with Parallel's other products and services. Earned PRIME is licensed to you and owned by Echelon Prime Foundation Cayman.<!-- --> </p><p>● We Own the App. You acknowledge and agree that we (or, as applicable, our licensors) owns all legal right, title and interest in and to all other elements of the App, and all intellectual property rights therein (including, without limitation, all Art, designs, systems, methods, information, computer code, software, services, “look and feel”, organization, compilation of the content, code, data, and all other elements of the App (collectively, the “App Materials”)). You acknowledge that the App Materials are protected by copyright, trade dress, patent, and trademark laws, international conventions, other relevant intellectual property and proprietary rights, and applicable laws. All App Materials are the copyrighted property of us or our licensors, and all trademarks, service marks, and trade names associated with the App or otherwise contained in the App Materials are proprietary to us or our licensors.</p><p>● No User License or Ownership of App Materials. Except as expressly set forth herein, your use of the App does not grant you ownership of or any other rights with respect to any content, code, data, or other App Materials that you may access on or through the App. We reserve all rights in and to the App Materials that are not expressly granted to you in these Terms.</p><p>● Further User Ownership Acknowledgements. For the sake of clarity, you understand and agree: (a) that your purchase of a CARD or earning of PRIME, whether via the App or otherwise, does not give you any rights or licenses in or to the App Materials (including, without limitation, our copyright in and to the associated Art) other than those expressly contained in these Terms; (b) that you do not have the right, except as otherwise set forth in these Terms, to reproduce, distribute, or otherwise commercialize any elements of the App Materials (including, without limitation, any Art) without our prior written consent in each case, which consent we may withhold in our sole and absolute discretion; and (c) that you will not apply for, register, or otherwise use or attempt to use any of our trademarks or service marks, or any confusingly similar marks, anywhere in the world without our prior written consent in each case, which consent we may withhold at our sole and absolute discretion.</p><p>● User License to Art. Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, we grant you a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license to use, copy, and display the Art for your Purchased CARDS, solely for the following purposes: (a) for your own personal, non-commercial use; (b) as part of a marketplace that permits the purchase and sale of your Purchased CARDS, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each CARD owner’s rights to display the Art for their Purchased CARD to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art; or (c) as part of a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of your Purchased CARD, provided that the website/application cryptographically verifies each CARD’s owner’s rights to display the Art for their Purchased CARD to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the Purchased CARD leaves the website/application.<!-- --> </p><p>● Restrictions on Ownership. You agree that you may not, nor permit any third party to do or attempt to do any of the foregoing without our (or, as applicable, our licensors’) express prior written consent in each case: (a) modify the Art for your Purchased CARD or Earned PRIME in any way, including, without limitation, the shapes, designs, drawings, attributes, or color schemes; (b) use the Art for your Purchased CARD, or otherwise use Earned PRIME, to advertise, market, or sell any third party product or service; (c) use the Art for your Purchased CARD in connection with images, videos, or other forms of media that depict hatred, intolerance, violence, cruelty, or anything else that could reasonably be found to constitute hate speech or otherwise infringe upon the rights of others; (d) use the Art for your Purchased CARD in movies, videos, or any other forms of media, except to the limited extent that such use is expressly permitted in these Terms or solely for your own personal, non-commercial use; (e) sell, distribute for commercial gain (including, without limitation, giving away in the hopes of eventual commercial gain), or otherwise commercialize merchandise that includes, contains, or consists of the Art for your Purchased CARD or any Earned PRIME; (f) attempt to trademark, copyright, or otherwise acquire additional intellectual property rights in or to the Art for your Purchased CARD; or (g) otherwise utilize the Art for your Purchased CARD or any Earned PRIME for your or any third party’s commercial benefit.</p><p>● Third Party IP. If the Art associated with your Purchased CARD contains Third Party IP, you understand and agree as follows: (a) that you will not have the right to use such Third Party IP in any way except as incorporated in the Art, and subject to the license and restrictions contained herein; (b) that, depending on the nature of the license granted from the owner of the Third Party IP, we may need to (and reserve every right to) pass through additional restrictions on your ability to use the Art; and (c) to the extent that we inform you of such additional restrictions in writing, you will be responsible for complying with all such restrictions from the date that you receive the notice, and that failure to do so will be deemed a breach of the license contained in this Section 5.</p><p>● Other Terms of License. The license granted in this Section 5 applies only to the extent that you continue to Own the applicable Purchased CARD. If at any time you sell, swap, donate, give away, transfer, or otherwise dispose of your Purchased CARD for any reason, the license granted in this Section 5 will immediately expire with respect to that CARD without the requirement of notice, and you will have no further rights in or to the Art for that CARD. The restrictions in this Section 5 ‘Restrictions on Ownership’ and ‘Third Party IP’ will survive the expiration or termination of these Terms.</p><p>● User Feedback. You may choose to submit comments, bug reports, ideas or other feedback about the App, including without limitation about how to improve the App (collectively, “Feedback”). By submitting any Feedback, you agree that we are free to use such Feedback at our discretion and without additional compensation to you, and to disclose such Feedback to third parties (whether on a non-confidential basis, or otherwise). You hereby grant us a perpetual, irrevocable, nonexclusive, worldwide license under all rights necessary for us to incorporate and use your Feedback for any purpose.</p><p>7.

ALL SMART CONTRACTS ARE CONDUCTED AND OCCUR ON THE DECENTRALIZED LEDGER WITHIN THE ETHEREUM NETWORK. WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER AND MAKE NO GUARANTEES OR PROMISES WITH RESPECT TO SMART CONTRACTS.</p><p>WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR LOSSES DUE TO BLOCKCHAINS OR ANY OTHER FEATURES OF THE ETHEREUM NETWORK, OR ANY ELECTRONIC WALLET, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LATE REPORT BY DEVELOPERS OR REPRESENTATIVES (OR NO REPORT AT ALL) OF ANY ISSUES WITH THE BLOCKCHAIN SUPPORTING THE ETHEREUM NETWORK, INCLUDING FORKS, TECHNICAL NODE ISSUES, OR ANY OTHER ISSUES HAVING FUND LOSSES AS A RESULT.</p><p>10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</p><p>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT WE, OUR PARENT, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES WHICH YOU MAY INCUR, HOWSOEVER CAUSED AND UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY LOSS OF PROFITS (WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY), LOSS OF GOODWILL OR BUSINESS REPUTATION, LOSS OF DATA, COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, DIMINUTION OF VALUE OR ANY OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSS, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p><p>YOU AGREE THAT OUR TOTAL, AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF (OR YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE) ANY PORTION OF THE APP, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF THE AMOUNTS YOU HAVE ACTUALLY AND LAWFULLY PAID US UNDER THESE TERMS IN THE TWO (2) MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THE DATE THE CLAIM AROSE.</p><p>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT WE HAVE MADE THE APP AVAILABLE TO YOU AND ENTERED INTO THESE TERMS IN RELIANCE UPON THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH HEREIN, WHICH REFLECT A REASONABLE AND FAIR ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN US AND YOU AND FORM AN ESSENTIAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN US AND YOU. WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE APP TO YOU WITHOUT THESE LIMITATIONS.</p><p>11. ASSUMPTION OF RISK</p><p>● Value and Volatility. The prices of collectible blockchain assets are extremely volatile and subjective and collectible blockchain assets have no inherent or intrinsic value. Fluctuations in the price of other digital assets could materially and adversely affect the value of your CARDS or PRIME, which may also be subject to significant price volatility. Each CARD or PRIME has no inherent or intrinsic value. We cannot guarantee that any CARDS purchased or PRIME earned will retain their original value, as the value of collectibles is inherently subjective and factors occurring outside of the Parallel ecosystem may materially impact the value and desirability of any particular CARD or, to the extent applicable, any earned PRIME.</p><p>● Tax Calculations. You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your CARD-related transactions. We are not responsible for determining the taxes that apply to your transactions on the App.</p><p>● Use of Blockchain. The App does not store, send, or receive CARDS or PRIME. This is because CARDS and PRIME exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on the App’s supporting blockchain in the Ethereum Network. Any transfer of CARDS or PRIME occurs within the supporting blockchain in the Ethereum Network, and not on the App.</p><p>● Inherent Risks with Internet Currency. There are risks associated with using an Internet-based currency, including, but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your electronic wallet. You accept and acknowledge that we will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the Ethereum Network, however caused.</p><p>● Regulatory Uncertainty. The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Parallel ecosystem, and therefore the potential utility or value of your CARDS or PRIME.</p><p>● Software Risks. Upgrades to the Ethereum Network, a hard fork in the Ethereum Network, or a change in how transactions are confirmed on the Ethereum Network may have unintended, adverse effects on all blockchains using the Ethereum Network’s ERC1155 standard, including the Parallel ecosystem.<!-- --> </p><p>12. INDEMNIFICATION</p><p>You agree to hold harmless and indemnify us and our parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, employees, advertisers, licensors, suppliers or partners from and against any claim, liability, loss, damage (actual and consequential) of any kind or nature, suit, judgment, litigation cost and attorneys' fees arising out of or in any way related to: (i) your breach of these Terms; (ii) your misuse of the App; or (iii) your violation of applicable laws, rules or regulations in connection with your access to or use of the App. You agree that we will have control of the defense or settlement of any such claims.</p><p>13. EXTERNAL SITES</p><p>The App may include hyperlinks to other websites or resources (collectively, the “External Sites”), which are provided solely as a convenience to our users. We have no control over any External Sites. You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for the availability of any External Sites, and that we do not endorse any advertising, products or other materials on or made available from or through any External Sites. Furthermore, you acknowledge and agree that we are not liable for any loss or damage which may be incurred as a result of the availability or unavailability of the External Sites, or as a result of any reliance placed by you upon the completeness, accuracy or existence of any advertising, products or other materials on, or made available from, any External Sites.</p><p>14. FORCE MAJEURE</p><p>● Force Majeure Events. We will not be liable or responsible to the you, nor be deemed to have defaulted under or breached these Terms, for any failure or delay in fulfilling or performing any of these Terms, when and to the extent such failure or delay is caused by or results from the following force majeure events (“Force Majeure Event(s)”): (a) acts of God; (b) flood, fire, earthquake, epidemics, pandemics, including the 2019 novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), tsunami, explosion; (c) war, invasion, hostilities (whether war is declared or not), terrorist threats or acts, riot or other civil unrest; (d) government order, law, or action; (e) embargoes or blockades in effect on or after the date of this agreement; (f) strikes, labour stoppages or slowdowns or other industrial disturbances; (g) shortage of adequate or suitable Internet connectivity, telecommunication breakdown or shortage of adequate power or electricity; and (h) other similar events beyond our control.</p><p>● Performance During Force Majeure Events. If we suffer a Force Majeure Event, we will use reasonable efforts to promptly notify you of the Force Majeure Event, stating the period of time the occurrence is expected to continue. We will use diligent efforts to end the failure or delay and ensure the effects of such Force Majeure Event are minimized. We will resume the performance of our obligations as soon as reasonably practicable after the removal of the cause. In the event that our failure or delay remains uncured for a period of forty-five (45) consecutive days following written notice given by us under this Section 13, we may thereafter terminate these Terms upon fifteen (15) days' written notice.</p><p>15. CHANGES TO THE APP</p><p>We are constantly innovating the App to help provide the best possible experience. You acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of the App, and any part of it, may change from time to time without prior notice to you, and that we may add new features and change any part of the App at any time without notice.</p><p>16. CHILDREN</p><p>You affirm that you are over the age of 18. The App is not intended for children under 18. If you are under the age of 18, you may not use the App. We do not knowingly collect information from or direct any of our content specifically to children under the age of 18. If we learn or have reason to suspect that you are a user who is under the age of 18, we will unfortunately have to close your account. Other countries may have different minimum age limits, and if you are below the minimum age for providing consent for data collection in your country, you may not use the App.<!-- --> </p><p>17. DISPUTE RESOLUTION; BINDING ARBITRATION</p><p>YOU ARE AGREEING TO GIVE UP ANY RIGHTS TO LITIGATE CLAIMS IN A COURT. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT MAY ALSO BE UNAVAILABLE OR MAY BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.</p><p>YOU HEREBY EXPRESSLY GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO HAVE A TRIAL BY JURY.</p><p>YOU HEREBY EXPRESSLY GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS OF CLAIMANTS IN ANY LAWSUIT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS INVOLVING ANY SUCH DISPUTE.</p><p>18. GENERAL</p><p>● Entire Agreement. These Terms constitute the entire legal agreement between you and us and will be deemed to be the final and integrated agreement between you and us, and govern your access to and use of the App, and completely replace any prior or contemporaneous agreements between you and us related to your access to or use of the App, whether oral or written.</p><p>● No Third-Party Beneficiaries. These Terms do not and are not intended to confer any rights or remedies upon any person or entity other than you.</p><p>● Interpretation. The language in these Terms will be interpreted as to its fair meaning, and not strictly for or against any party.</p><p>● Severability. Should any part of these Terms be held invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable, that portion will deemed severed from these Terms and will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions of these Terms.</p><p>● No Waivers. Our failure or delay to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute or be deemed a waiver of future exercise or enforcement of such right or provision. The waiver of any right or provision of these Terms will be effective only if in writing and signed for and on behalf of us by a duly authorized representative.</p><p>● Governing Law. All matters arising out of or relating to these Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Province of Ontario and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the Province of Ontario or any other jurisdiction).</p><p>● Venue. Subject to Section 17 of these Terms, any legal action or proceeding arising under these Terms will be brought exclusively in the Supreme Court of the Province of Ontario located in Toronto, Ontario, and we and you irrevocably consent and attorn to the personal jurisdiction and venue there.</p><p>● Notices. We may provide you with any notices (including, without limitation those regarding changes to these Terms) by email or postings on the App. By providing us with your email address, you consent to our using the email address to send you any notices. Notices sent by email will be effective when we send the email, and notices we provide by posting will be effective upon posting. It is your responsibility to keep your email address current.</p><p>● Assignment. You may not assign any of your rights or obligations under these Terms, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign our rights and obligations under these Terms in our sole discretion to an affiliate, or in connection with an acquisition, sale or merger.</p></div><div class="flex flex-col gap-6

Humankind grew increasingly desperate to find an unlimited source of energy to rely upon. Brilliant minds around the world assembled for the sake of Earth's salvation.

New homes that were once considered fiction, became reality.

This energy-rich invitation brings new conflict, as each Parallel believes Earth is theirs to claim.\n\naugencore-summary = None have known the true harshness of space like those aboard CAINE-1.

Humankind grew increasingly desperate to find an unlimited source of energy to rely upon. Brilliant minds around the world assembled for the sake of Earth's salvation. At a loss for alternatives, they began experimenting with fission augmented by anti-matter. In their haste, they unleashed catastrophe on an unprecedented scale.

New homes that were once considered fiction, became reality. However, at last, the spark that humankind had kindled on Earth those millennia ago has ignited into the unlimited power source that was promised, calling each Parallel back home. This energy-rich invitation brings new conflict, as each Parallel believes Earth is theirs to claim.\n\naugencore-summary = None have known the true harshness of space like those aboard CAINE-1.

Humankind grew increasingly desperate to find an unlimited source of energy to rely upon. Brilliant minds around the world assembled for the sake of Earth's salvation. At a loss for alternatives, they began experimenting with fission augmented by anti-matter. In their haste, they unleashed catastrophe on an unprecedented scale. Fleeing certain death, the mass exodus of Earth began. This course led to the inception of five parallel streams.\nstory-earthen = The \u003cearthen\u003eEarthen\u003c/earthen\u003e, a civilization of those left behind, remained and cultivated a thriving society through patience and perseverance.\nstory-kathari = The \u003ckathari\u003eKathari\u003c/kathari\u003e developed groundbreaking enhancements to the human genome deep below the frigid surface of Jupiter's moon, Europa.\nstory-marcolian = The \u003cmarcolian\u003eMarcolians\u003c/marcolian\u003e, in pursuit of absolute supremacy, rose and promptly laid claim to the entire red planet of Mars.\nstory-augencore = The \u003caugencore\u003eAugencore\u003c/augencore\u003e found refuge on their foundry ship Caine-1, augmenting themselves for deep space survival.\nstory-shroud = The \u003cshroud\u003eShroud\u003c/shroud\u003e, a mysterious presence in the universe - whereabouts currently unknown.\nstory-paragraph-2 = For 10,000 years each Parallel would advance their way of life far beyond the constraints of Earth. New homes that were once considered fiction, became reality. However, at last, the spark that humankind had kindled on Earth those millennia ago has ignited into the unlimited power source that was promised, calling each Parallel back home. This energy-rich invitation brings new conflict, as each Parallel believes Earth is theirs to claim.\n\naugencore-summary = None have known the true harshness of space like those aboard CAINE-1. For thousands of years, the Augencore have used technology to shape their bodies into perfect machines, hardened by the unforgiving void.

Underground, they thrived, engineering their own bodies to adapt to any environment.

Humankind grew increasingly desperate to find an unlimited source of energy to rely upon. Brilliant minds around the world assembled for the sake of Earth's salvation. At a loss for alternatives, they began experimenting with fission augmented by anti-matter. In their haste, they unleashed catastrophe on an unprecedented scale.

New homes that were once considered fiction, became reality.

This energy-rich invitation brings new conflict, as each Parallel believes Earth is theirs to claim.\n\naugencore-summary = None have known the true harshness of space like those aboard CAINE-1.

Humankind grew increasingly desperate to find an unlimited source of energy to rely upon. Brilliant minds around the world assembled for the sake of Earth's salvation. At a loss for alternatives, they began experimenting with fission augmented by anti-matter. In their haste, they unleashed catastrophe on an unprecedented scale. Fleeing certain death, the mass exodus of Earth began. This course led to the inception of five parallel streams.\nstory-earthen = The \u003cearthen\u003eEarthen\u003c/earthen\u003e, a civilization of those left behind, remained and cultivated a thriving society through patience and perseverance.\nstory-kathari = The \u003ckathari\u003eKathari\u003c/kathari\u003e developed groundbreaking enhancements to the human genome deep below the frigid surface of Jupiter's moon, Europa.\nstory-marcolian = The \u003cmarcolian\u003eMarcolians\u003c/marcolian\u003e, in pursuit of absolute supremacy, rose and promptly laid claim to the entire red planet of Mars.\nstory-augencore = The \u003caugencore\u003eAugencore\u003c/augencore\u003e found refuge on their foundry ship Caine-1, augmenting themselves for deep space survival.\nstory-shroud = The \u003cshroud\u003eShroud\u003c/shroud\u003e, a mysterious presence in the universe - whereabouts currently unknown.\nstory-paragraph-2 = For 10,000 years each Parallel would advance their way of life far beyond the constraints of Earth. New homes that were once considered fiction, became reality. However, at last, the spark that humankind had kindled on Earth those millennia ago has ignited into the unlimited power source that was promised, calling each Parallel back home. This energy-rich invitation brings new conflict, as each Parallel believes Earth is theirs to claim.\n\naugencore-summary = None have known the true harshness of space like those aboard CAINE-1. For thousands of years, the Augencore have used technology to shape their bodies into perfect machines, hardened by the unforgiving void. With a dying engine, and news that Earth is once more habitable, the Augencore return to Earth, bolstered by the prospect of home.\naugencore-sign-off = Find what you can build yourself to be.\nearthen-summary = The events of The Priming changed the face of the Earth, and the faces of the Earth's stalwart inhabitants. Devoted to the teachings of their new leaders, the Earthen defend a changed world from those who would do it harm.\nearthen-sign-off = Listen to the call of your home.\nkathari-summary = The Kathari were born from necessity - a need to survive in the harsh and frozen depths of Europa. Underground, they thrived, engineering their own bodies to adapt to any environment. Now, after thousands of years of cloning and adaptations, the threat of genetic decay looms large and heavy over their heads. They return to Earth, hoping to find the key to their salvation.\nkathari-sign-off = Adapt and survive. Your many lives await.\nmarcolian-summary = Humanity has thrived upon the once red planet. Working as one, the Marcolians have turned desolate rock into a teeming metropolis of meticulous order and peerless technology. Having conquered Mars, they look to Earth as their next endeavour.\nmarcolian-sign-off = What is deservedly ours is ours to take.\nshroud-summary = Colonists aboard the ship known as the New Dawn set off to explore the unknown depths of space. They were enveloped in a black hole, coming out from the Singularity as something new to this universe. Now, serving a powerful entity from the Singularity known as The Great One, they operate in the shadows of space, preparing our solar system for the arrival of their enigmatic leader.\nshroud-sign-off = Ascension through the power of The Great One.\n","title-download = Download | Parallel\nplay-open-beta-for-free = Play open beta for free\ndont-have-parallel-account = I don\u0026apos;t have a Parallel account yet\nhave-parallel-account = I have a Parallel account\nalready-registered = Already registered?\ndownload-for-windows = Download for Windows\ndownload-from-parallel = Download from Parallel\ndownload-from-epic = Download from Epic\nplease-check-email-to-verify-account = Please check your email to verify account before playing\nplease-note-our-client-is-only-supported-on-windows-machines = Please note our client is only supported on Windows machines\nminimum-specs =  Min. specs - Windows 7 (64-bit version) - Intel Core i5-10400 @2.90 - 4 GB RAM Nvidia GeForce 1060 6GB - 4 GB available storage space - DirectX 12\ndownloading-parallel = Downloading Parallel\u003cdotDotDot\u003e\u003c/dotDotDot\u003e\ntry-again-downloading-parallel = If your download didn\u0026apos;t start. \u003ctryAgainLink\u003eTry again\u003c/tryAgainLink\u003e","title-download = Download | Parallel\nplay-open-beta-for-free = Play open beta for free\ndont-have-parallel-account = I don\u0026apos;t have a Parallel account yet\nhave-parallel-account = I have a Parallel account\nalready-registered = Already registered?\ndownload-for-windows = Download for Windows\ndownload-from-parallel = Download from Parallel\ndownload-from-epic = Download from Epic\nplease-check-email-to-verify-account = Please check your email to verify account before playing\nplease-note-our-client-is-only-supported-on-windows-machines = Please note our client is only supported on Windows machines\nminimum-specs =  Min. specs - Windows 7 (64-bit version) - Intel Core i5-10400 @2.90 - 4 GB RAM Nvidia GeForce 1060 6GB - 4 GB available storage space - DirectX 12\ndownloading-parallel = Downloading Parallel\u003cdotDotDot\u003e\u003c/dotDotDot\u003e\ntry-again-downloading-parallel = If your download didn\u0026apos;t start. \u003ctryAgainLink\u003eTry again\u003c/tryAgainLink\u003e","password-reset-message = Enter your e-mail address below, and we'll send you an e-mail allowing you to reset your password.\nenter-email = \n    .placeholder = Enter Email\n","artigraph-prime-approval-title = Prime Contract Approval\nartigraph-prime-approval-description = To proceed with Artigraph upgrade, please set a Prime Spend amount.

Humankind grew increasingly desperate to find an unlimited source of energy to rely upon. Brilliant minds around the world assembled for the sake of Earth's salvation. At a loss for alternatives, they began experimenting with fission augmented by anti-matter. In their haste, they unleashed catastrophe on an unprecedented scale. Fleeing certain death, the mass exodus of Earth began. This course led to the inception of five parallel streams.\nstory-earthen = The \u003cearthen\u003eEarthen\u003c/earthen\u003e, a civilization of those left behind, remained and cultivated a thriving society through patience and perseverance.\nstory-kathari = The \u003ckathari\u003eKathari\u003c/kathari\u003e developed groundbreaking enhancements to the human genome deep below the frigid surface of Jupiter's moon, Europa.\nstory-marcolian = The \u003cmarcolian\u003eMarcolians\u003c/marcolian\u003e, in pursuit of absolute supremacy, rose and promptly laid claim to the entire red planet of Mars.\nstory-augencore = The \u003caugencore\u003eAugencore\u003c/augencore\u003e found refuge on their foundry ship Caine-1, augmenting themselves for deep space survival.\nstory-shroud = The \u003cshroud\u003eShroud\u003c/shroud\u003e, a mysterious presence in the universe - whereabouts currently unknown.\nstory-paragraph-2 = For 10,000 years each Parallel would advance their way of life far beyond the constraints of Earth. New homes that were once considered fiction, became reality. However, at last, the spark that humankind had kindled on Earth those millennia ago has ignited into the unlimited power source that was promised, calling each Parallel back home. This energy-rich invitation brings new conflict, as each Parallel believes Earth is theirs to claim.\n\naugencore-summary = None have known the true harshness of space like those aboard CAINE-1. For thousands of years, the Augencore have used technology to shape their bodies into perfect machines, hardened by the unforgiving void. With a dying engine, and news that Earth is once more habitable, the Augencore return to Earth, bolstered by the prospect of home.\naugencore-sign-off = Find what you can build yourself to be.\nearthen-summary = The events of The Priming changed the face of the Earth, and the faces of the Earth's stalwart inhabitants. Devoted to the teachings of their new leaders, the Earthen defend a changed world from those who would do it harm.\nearthen-sign-off = Listen to the call of your home.\nkathari-summary = The Kathari were born from necessity - a need to survive in the harsh and frozen depths of Europa. Underground, they thrived, engineering their own bodies to adapt to any environment. Now, after thousands of years of cloning and adaptations, the threat of genetic decay looms large and heavy over their heads. They return to Earth, hoping to find the key to their salvation.\nkathari-sign-off = Adapt and survive. Your many lives await.\nmarcolian-summary = Humanity has thrived upon the once red planet.

Humankind grew increasingly desperate to find an unlimited source of energy to rely upon. Brilliant minds around the world assembled for the sake of Earth's salvation. At a loss for alternatives, they began experimenting with fission augmented by anti-matter. In their haste, they unleashed catastrophe on an unprecedented scale. Fleeing certain death, the mass exodus of Earth began.

New homes that were once considered fiction, became reality. However, at last, the spark that humankind had kindled on Earth those millennia ago has ignited into the unlimited power source that was promised, calling each Parallel back home. This energy-rich invitation brings new conflict, as each Parallel believes Earth is theirs to claim.\n\naugencore-summary = None have known the true harshness of space like those aboard CAINE-1.

Humankind grew increasingly desperate to find an unlimited source of energy to rely upon. Brilliant minds around the world assembled for the sake of Earth's salvation. At a loss for alternatives, they began experimenting with fission augmented by anti-matter. In their haste, they unleashed catastrophe on an unprecedented scale. Fleeing certain death, the mass exodus of Earth began. This course led to the inception of five parallel streams.\nstory-earthen = The \u003cearthen\u003eEarthen\u003c/earthen\u003e, a civilization of those left behind, remained and cultivated a thriving society through patience and perseverance.\nstory-kathari = The \u003ckathari\u003eKathari\u003c/kathari\u003e developed groundbreaking enhancements to the human genome deep below the frigid surface of Jupiter's moon, Europa.\nstory-marcolian = The \u003cmarcolian\u003eMarcolians\u003c/marcolian\u003e, in pursuit of absolute supremacy, rose and promptly laid claim to the entire red planet of Mars.\nstory-augencore = The \u003caugencore\u003eAugencore\u003c/augencore\u003e found refuge on their foundry ship Caine-1, augmenting themselves for deep space survival.\nstory-shroud = The \u003cshroud\u003eShroud\u003c/shroud\u003e, a mysterious presence in the universe - whereabouts currently unknown.\nstory-paragraph-2 = For 10,000 years each Parallel would advance their way of life far beyond the constraints of Earth. New homes that were once considered fiction, became reality. However, at last, the spark that humankind had kindled on Earth those millennia ago has ignited into the unlimited power source that was promised, calling each Parallel back home. This energy-rich invitation brings new conflict, as each Parallel believes Earth is theirs to claim.\n\naugencore-summary = None have known the true harshness of space like those aboard CAINE-1. For thousands of years, the Augencore have used technology to shape their bodies into perfect machines, hardened by the unforgiving void. With a dying engine, and news that Earth is once more habitable, the Augencore return to Earth, bolstered by the prospect of home.\naugencore-sign-off = Find what you can build yourself to be.\nearthen-summary = The events of The Priming changed the face of the Earth, and the faces of the Earth's stalwart inhabitants.

Underground, they thrived, engineering their own bodies to adapt to any environment. Now, after thousands of years of cloning and adaptations, the threat of genetic decay looms large and heavy over their heads.

Humankind grew increasingly desperate to find an unlimited source of energy to rely upon. Brilliant minds around the world assembled for the sake of Earth's salvation. At a loss for alternatives, they began experimenting with fission augmented by anti-matter. In their haste, they unleashed catastrophe on an unprecedented scale. Fleeing certain death, the mass exodus of Earth began. This course led to the inception of five parallel streams.\nstory-earthen = The \u003cearthen\u003eEarthen\u003c/earthen\u003e, a civilization of those left behind, remained and cultivated a thriving society through patience and perseverance.\nstory-kathari = The \u003ckathari\u003eKathari\u003c/kathari\u003e developed groundbreaking enhancements to the human genome deep below the frigid surface of Jupiter's moon, Europa.\nstory-marcolian = The \u003cmarcolian\u003eMarcolians\u003c/marcolian\u003e, in pursuit of absolute supremacy, rose and promptly laid claim to the entire red planet of Mars.\nstory-augencore = The \u003caugencore\u003eAugencore\u003c/augencore\u003e found refuge on their foundry ship Caine-1, augmenting themselves for deep space survival.\nstory-shroud = The \u003cshroud\u003eShroud\u003c/shroud\u003e, a mysterious presence in the universe - whereabouts currently unknown.\nstory-paragraph-2 = For 10,000 years each Parallel would advance their way of life far beyond the constraints of Earth. New homes that were once considered fiction, became reality. However, at last, the spark that humankind had kindled on Earth those millennia ago has ignited into the unlimited power source that was promised, calling each Parallel back home. This energy-rich invitation brings new conflict, as each Parallel believes Earth is theirs to claim.\n\naugencore-summary = None have known the true harshness of space like those aboard CAINE-1. For thousands of years, the Augencore have used technology to shape their bodies into perfect machines, hardened by the unforgiving void. With a dying engine, and news that Earth is once more habitable, the Augencore return to Earth, bolstered by the prospect of home.\naugencore-sign-off = Find what you can build yourself to be.\nearthen-summary = The events of The Priming changed the face of the Earth, and the faces of the Earth's stalwart inhabitants. Devoted to the teachings of their new leaders, the Earthen defend a changed world from those who would do it harm.\nearthen-sign-off = Listen to the call of your home.\nkathari-summary = The Kathari were born from necessity - a need to survive in the harsh and frozen depths of Europa. Underground, they thrived, engineering their own bodies to adapt to any environment. Now, after thousands of years of cloning and adaptations, the threat of genetic decay looms large and heavy over their heads. They return to Earth, hoping to find the key to their salvation.\nkathari-sign-off = Adapt and survive. Your many lives await.\nmarcolian-summary = Humanity has thrived upon the once red planet.

Having conquered Mars, they look to Earth as their next endeavour.\nmarcolian-sign-off = What is deservedly ours is ours to take.\nshroud-summary = Colonists aboard the ship known as the New Dawn set off to explore the unknown depths of space. They were enveloped in a black hole, coming out from the Singularity as something new to this universe.

Humankind grew increasingly desperate to find an unlimited source of energy to rely upon. Brilliant minds around the world assembled for the sake of Earth's salvation. At a loss for alternatives, they began experimenting with fission augmented by anti-matter. In their haste, they unleashed catastrophe on an unprecedented scale. Fleeing certain death, the mass exodus of Earth began. This course led to the inception of five parallel streams.\nstory-earthen = The \u003cearthen\u003eEarthen\u003c/earthen\u003e, a civilization of those left behind, remained and cultivated a thriving society through patience and perseverance.\nstory-kathari = The \u003ckathari\u003eKathari\u003c/kathari\u003e developed groundbreaking enhancements to the human genome deep below the frigid surface of Jupiter's moon, Europa.\nstory-marcolian = The \u003cmarcolian\u003eMarcolians\u003c/marcolian\u003e, in pursuit of absolute supremacy, rose and promptly laid claim to the entire red planet of Mars.\nstory-augencore = The \u003caugencore\u003eAugencore\u003c/augencore\u003e found refuge on their foundry ship Caine-1, augmenting themselves for deep space survival.\nstory-shroud = The \u003cshroud\u003eShroud\u003c/shroud\u003e, a mysterious presence in the universe - whereabouts currently unknown.\nstory-paragraph-2 = For 10,000 years each Parallel would advance their way of life far beyond the constraints of Earth. New homes that were once considered fiction, became reality. However, at last, the spark that humankind had kindled on Earth those millennia ago has ignited into the unlimited power source that was promised, calling each Parallel back home. This energy-rich invitation brings new conflict, as each Parallel believes Earth is theirs to claim.\n\naugencore-summary = None have known the true harshness of space like those aboard CAINE-1. For thousands of years, the Augencore have used technology to shape their bodies into perfect machines, hardened by the unforgiving void.

Underground, they thrived, engineering their own bodies to adapt to any environment.

Humankind grew increasingly desperate to find an unlimited source of energy to rely upon. Brilliant minds around the world assembled for the sake of Earth's salvation.

Humankind grew increasingly desperate to find an unlimited source of energy to rely upon. Brilliant minds around the world assembled for the sake of Earth's salvation. At a loss for alternatives, they began experimenting with fission augmented by anti-matter. In their haste, they unleashed catastrophe on an unprecedented scale. Fleeing certain death, the mass exodus of Earth began. This course led to the inception of five parallel streams.\nstory-earthen = The \u003cearthen\u003eEarthen\u003c/earthen\u003e, a civilization of those left behind, remained and cultivated a thriving society through patience and perseverance.\nstory-kathari = The \u003ckathari\u003eKathari\u003c/kathari\u003e developed groundbreaking enhancements to the human genome deep below the frigid surface of Jupiter's moon, Europa.\nstory-marcolian = The \u003cmarcolian\u003eMarcolians\u003c/marcolian\u003e, in pursuit of absolute supremacy, rose and promptly laid claim to the entire red planet of Mars.\nstory-augencore = The \u003caugencore\u003eAugencore\u003c/augencore\u003e found refuge on their foundry ship Caine-1, augmenting themselves for deep space survival.\nstory-shroud = The \u003cshroud\u003eShroud\u003c/shroud\u003e, a mysterious presence in the universe - whereabouts currently unknown.\nstory-paragraph-2 = For 10,000 years each Parallel would advance their way of life far beyond the constraints of Earth. New homes that were once considered fiction, became reality. However, at last, the spark that humankind had kindled on Earth those millennia ago has ignited into the unlimited power source that was promised, calling each Parallel back home. This energy-rich invitation brings new conflict, as each Parallel believes Earth is theirs to claim.\n\naugencore-summary = None have known the true harshness of space like those aboard CAINE-1. For thousands of years, the Augencore have used technology to shape their bodies into perfect machines, hardened by the unforgiving void. With a dying engine, and news that Earth is once more habitable, the Augencore return to Earth, bolstered by the prospect of home.\naugencore-sign-off = Find what you can build yourself to be.\nearthen-summary = The events of The Priming changed the face of the Earth, and the faces of the Earth's stalwart inhabitants. Devoted to the teachings of their new leaders, the Earthen defend a changed world from those who would do it harm.\nearthen-sign-off = Listen to the call of your home.\nkathari-summary = The Kathari were born from necessity - a need to survive in the harsh and frozen depths of Europa. Underground, they thrived, engineering their own bodies to adapt to any environment. Now, after thousands of years of cloning and adaptations, the threat of genetic decay looms large and heavy over their heads. They return to Earth, hoping to find the key to their salvation.\nkathari-sign-off = Adapt and survive. Your many lives await.\nmarcolian-summary = Humanity has thrived upon the once red planet.

Humankind grew increasingly desperate to find an unlimited source of energy to rely upon. Brilliant minds around the world assembled for the sake of Earth's salvation. At a loss for alternatives, they began experimenting with fission augmented by anti-matter. In their haste, they unleashed catastrophe on an unprecedented scale.

New homes that were once considered fiction, became reality.

This energy-rich invitation brings new conflict, as each Parallel believes Earth is theirs to claim.\n\naugencore-summary = None have known the true harshness of space like those aboard CAINE-1.

Humankind grew increasingly desperate to find an unlimited source of energy to rely upon. Brilliant minds around the world assembled for the sake of Earth's salvation. At a loss for alternatives, they began experimenting with fission augmented by anti-matter. In their haste, they unleashed catastrophe on an unprecedented scale.

New homes that were once considered fiction, became reality. However, at last, the spark that humankind had kindled on Earth those millennia ago has ignited into the unlimited power source that was promised, calling each Parallel back home. This energy-rich invitation brings new conflict, as each Parallel believes Earth is theirs to claim.\n\naugencore-summary = None have known the true harshness of space like those aboard CAINE-1.

Humankind grew increasingly desperate to find an unlimited source of energy to rely upon. Brilliant minds around the world assembled for the sake of Earth's salvation. At a loss for alternatives, they began experimenting with fission augmented by anti-matter. In their haste, they unleashed catastrophe on an unprecedented scale. Fleeing certain death, the mass exodus of Earth began. This course led to the inception of five parallel streams.\nstory-earthen = The \u003cearthen\u003eEarthen\u003c/earthen\u003e, a civilization of those left behind, remained and cultivated a thriving society through patience and perseverance.\nstory-kathari = The \u003ckathari\u003eKathari\u003c/kathari\u003e developed groundbreaking enhancements to the human genome deep below the frigid surface of Jupiter's moon, Europa.\nstory-marcolian = The \u003cmarcolian\u003eMarcolians\u003c/marcolian\u003e, in pursuit of absolute supremacy, rose and promptly laid claim to the entire red planet of Mars.\nstory-augencore = The \u003caugencore\u003eAugencore\u003c/augencore\u003e found refuge on their foundry ship Caine-1, augmenting themselves for deep space survival.\nstory-shroud = The \u003cshroud\u003eShroud\u003c/shroud\u003e, a mysterious presence in the universe - whereabouts currently unknown.\nstory-paragraph-2 = For 10,000 years each Parallel would advance their way of life far beyond the constraints of Earth. New homes that were once considered fiction, became reality. However, at last, the spark that humankind had kindled on Earth those millennia ago has ignited into the unlimited power source that was promised, calling each Parallel back home. This energy-rich invitation brings new conflict, as each Parallel believes Earth is theirs to claim.\n\naugencore-summary = None have known the true harshness of space like those aboard CAINE-1. For thousands of years, the Augencore have used technology to shape their bodies into perfect machines, hardened by the unforgiving void.

Humankind grew increasingly desperate to find an unlimited source of energy to rely upon. Brilliant minds around the world assembled for the sake of Earth's salvation. At a loss for alternatives, they began experimenting with fission augmented by anti-matter. In their haste, they unleashed catastrophe on an unprecedented scale. Fleeing certain death, the mass exodus of Earth began. This course led to the inception of five parallel streams.\nstory-earthen = The \u003cearthen\u003eEarthen\u003c/earthen\u003e, a civilization of those left behind, remained and cultivated a thriving society through patience and perseverance.\nstory-kathari = The \u003ckathari\u003eKathari\u003c/kathari\u003e developed groundbreaking enhancements to the human genome deep below the frigid surface of Jupiter's moon, Europa.\nstory-marcolian = The \u003cmarcolian\u003eMarcolians\u003c/marcolian\u003e, in pursuit of absolute supremacy, rose and promptly laid claim to the entire red planet of Mars.\nstory-augencore = The \u003caugencore\u003eAugencore\u003c/augencore\u003e found refuge on their foundry ship Caine-1, augmenting themselves for deep space survival.\nstory-shroud = The \u003cshroud\u003eShroud\u003c/shroud\u003e, a mysterious presence in the universe - whereabouts currently unknown.\nstory-paragraph-2 = For 10,000 years each Parallel would advance their way of life far beyond the constraints of Earth. New homes that were once considered fiction, became reality. However, at last, the spark that humankind had kindled on Earth those millennia ago has ignited into the unlimited power source that was promised, calling each Parallel back home. This energy-rich invitation brings new conflict, as each Parallel believes Earth is theirs to claim.\n\naugencore-summary = None have known the true harshness of space like those aboard CAINE-1. For thousands of years, the Augencore have used technology to shape their bodies into perfect machines, hardened by the unforgiving void. With a dying engine, and news that Earth is once more habitable, the Augencore return to Earth, bolstered by the prospect of home.\naugencore-sign-off = Find what you can build yourself to be.\nearthen-summary = The events of The Priming changed the face of the Earth, and the faces of the Earth's stalwart inhabitants. Devoted to the teachings of their new leaders, the Earthen defend a changed world from those who would do it harm.\nearthen-sign-off = Listen to the call of your home.\nkathari-summary = The Kathari were born from necessity - a need to survive in the harsh and frozen depths of Europa. Underground, they thrived, engineering their own bodies to adapt to any environment. Now, after thousands of years of cloning and adaptations, the threat of genetic decay looms large and heavy over their heads. They return to Earth, hoping to find the key to their salvation.\nkathari-sign-off = Adapt and survive. Your many lives await.\nmarcolian-summary = Humanity has thrived upon the once red planet.

Humankind grew increasingly desperate to find an unlimited source of energy to rely upon. Brilliant minds around the world assembled for the sake of Earth's salvation. At a loss for alternatives, they began experimenting with fission augmented by anti-matter. In their haste, they unleashed catastrophe on an unprecedented scale. Fleeing certain death, the mass exodus of Earth began. This course led to the inception of five parallel streams.\nstory-earthen = The \u003cearthen\u003eEarthen\u003c/earthen\u003e, a civilization of those left behind, remained and cultivated a thriving society through patience and perseverance.\nstory-kathari = The \u003ckathari\u003eKathari\u003c/kathari\u003e developed groundbreaking enhancements to the human genome deep below the frigid surface of Jupiter's moon, Europa.\nstory-marcolian = The \u003cmarcolian\u003eMarcolians\u003c/marcolian\u003e, in pursuit of absolute supremacy, rose and promptly laid claim to the entire red planet of Mars.\nstory-augencore = The \u003caugencore\u003eAugencore\u003c/augencore\u003e found refuge on their foundry ship Caine-1, augmenting themselves for deep space survival.\nstory-shroud = The \u003cshroud\u003eShroud\u003c/shroud\u003e, a mysterious presence in the universe - whereabouts currently unknown.\nstory-paragraph-2 = For 10,000 years each Parallel would advance their way of life far beyond the constraints of Earth. New homes that were once considered fiction, became reality.

This energy-rich invitation brings new conflict, as each Parallel believes Earth is theirs to claim.\n\naugencore-summary = None have known the true harshness of space like those aboard CAINE-1.

Humankind grew increasingly desperate to find an unlimited source of energy to rely upon. Brilliant minds around the world assembled for the sake of Earth's salvation.
