Humankind grew increasingly desperate to find an unlimited source of energy to rely upon. Brilliant minds around the world assembled for the sake of Earth's salvation. At a loss for alternatives, they began experimenting with fission augmented by anti-matter. In their haste, they unleashed catastrophe on an unprecedented scale.

This course led to the inception of five parallel streams.\nstory-earthen = The \u003cearthen\u003eEarthen\u003c/earthen\u003e, a civilization of those left behind, remained and cultivated a thriving society through patience and perseverance.\nstory-kathari = The \u003ckathari\u003eKathari\u003c/kathari\u003e developed groundbreaking enhancements to the human genome deep below the frigid surface of Jupiter's moon, Europa.\nstory-marcolian = The \u003cmarcolian\u003eMarcolians\u003c/marcolian\u003e, in pursuit of absolute supremacy, rose and promptly laid claim to the entire red planet of Mars.\nstory-augencore = The \u003caugencore\u003eAugencore\u003c/augencore\u003e found refuge on their foundry ship Caine-1, augmenting themselves for deep space survival.\nstory-shroud = The \u003cshroud\u003eShroud\u003c/shroud\u003e, a mysterious presence in the universe - whereabouts currently unknown.\nstory-paragraph-2 = For 10,000 years each Parallel would advance their way of life far beyond the constraints of Earth. New homes that were once considered fiction, became reality.

This energy-rich invitation brings new conflict, as each Parallel believes Earth is theirs to claim.\n\naugencore-summary = None have known the true harshness of space like those aboard CAINE-1.

Humankind grew increasingly desperate to find an unlimited source of energy to rely upon. Brilliant minds around the world assembled for the sake of Earth's salvation. At a loss for alternatives, they began experimenting with fission augmented by anti-matter. In their haste, they unleashed catastrophe on an unprecedented scale. Fleeing certain death, the mass exodus of Earth began. This course led to the inception of five parallel streams.\nstory-earthen = The \u003cearthen\u003eEarthen\u003c/earthen\u003e, a civilization of those left behind, remained and cultivated a thriving society through patience and perseverance.\nstory-kathari = The \u003ckathari\u003eKathari\u003c/kathari\u003e developed groundbreaking enhancements to the human genome deep below the frigid surface of Jupiter's moon, Europa.\nstory-marcolian = The \u003cmarcolian\u003eMarcolians\u003c/marcolian\u003e, in pursuit of absolute supremacy, rose and promptly laid claim to the entire red planet of Mars.\nstory-augencore = The \u003caugencore\u003eAugencore\u003c/augencore\u003e found refuge on their foundry ship Caine-1, augmenting themselves for deep space survival.\nstory-shroud = The \u003cshroud\u003eShroud\u003c/shroud\u003e, a mysterious presence in the universe - whereabouts currently unknown.\nstory-paragraph-2 = For 10,000 years each Parallel would advance their way of life far beyond the constraints of Earth. New homes that were once considered fiction, became reality. However, at last, the spark that humankind had kindled on Earth those millennia ago has ignited into the unlimited power source that was promised, calling each Parallel back home. This energy-rich invitation brings new conflict, as each Parallel believes Earth is theirs to claim.\n\naugencore-summary = None have known the true harshness of space like those aboard CAINE-1. For thousands of years, the Augencore have used technology to shape their bodies into perfect machines, hardened by the unforgiving void. With a dying engine, and news that Earth is once more habitable, the Augencore return to Earth, bolstered by the prospect of home.\naugencore-sign-off = Find what you can build yourself to be.\nearthen-summary = The events of The Priming changed the face of the Earth, and the faces of the Earth's stalwart inhabitants. Devoted to the teachings of their new leaders, the Earthen defend a changed world from those who would do it harm.\nearthen-sign-off = Listen to the call of your home.\nkathari-summary = The Kathari were born from necessity - a need to survive in the harsh and frozen depths of Europa. Underground, they thrived, engineering their own bodies to adapt to any environment. Now, after thousands of years of cloning and adaptations, the threat of genetic decay looms large and heavy over their heads. They return to Earth, hoping to find the key to their salvation.\nkathari-sign-off = Adapt and survive. Your many lives await.\nmarcolian-summary = Humanity has thrived upon the once red planet.

Humankind grew increasingly desperate to find an unlimited source of energy to rely upon. Brilliant minds around the world assembled for the sake of Earth's salvation. At a loss for alternatives, they began experimenting with fission augmented by anti-matter. In their haste, they unleashed catastrophe on an unprecedented scale. Fleeing certain death, the mass exodus of Earth began. This course led to the inception of five parallel streams.\nstory-earthen = The \u003cearthen\u003eEarthen\u003c/earthen\u003e, a civilization of those left behind, remained and cultivated a thriving society through patience and perseverance.\nstory-kathari = The \u003ckathari\u003eKathari\u003c/kathari\u003e developed groundbreaking enhancements to the human genome deep below the frigid surface of Jupiter's moon, Europa.\nstory-marcolian = The \u003cmarcolian\u003eMarcolians\u003c/marcolian\u003e, in pursuit of absolute supremacy, rose and promptly laid claim to the entire red planet of Mars.\nstory-augencore = The \u003caugencore\u003eAugencore\u003c/augencore\u003e found refuge on their foundry ship Caine-1, augmenting themselves for deep space survival.\nstory-shroud = The \u003cshroud\u003eShroud\u003c/shroud\u003e, a mysterious presence in the universe - whereabouts currently unknown.\nstory-paragraph-2 = For 10,000 years each Parallel would advance their way of life far beyond the constraints of Earth. New homes that were once considered fiction, became reality. However, at last, the spark that humankind had kindled on Earth those millennia ago has ignited into the unlimited power source that was promised, calling each Parallel back home. This energy-rich invitation brings new conflict, as each Parallel believes Earth is theirs to claim.\n\naugencore-summary = None have known the true harshness of space like those aboard CAINE-1. For thousands of years, the Augencore have used technology to shape their bodies into perfect machines, hardened by the unforgiving void.

Underground, they thrived, engineering their own bodies to adapt to any environment.

Humankind grew increasingly desperate to find an unlimited source of energy to rely upon. Brilliant minds around the world assembled for the sake of Earth's salvation. At a loss for alternatives, they began experimenting with fission augmented by anti-matter. In their haste, they unleashed catastrophe on an unprecedented scale. Fleeing certain death, the mass exodus of Earth began. This course led to the inception of five parallel streams.\nstory-earthen = The \u003cearthen\u003eEarthen\u003c/earthen\u003e, a civilization of those left behind, remained and cultivated a thriving society through patience and perseverance.\nstory-kathari = The \u003ckathari\u003eKathari\u003c/kathari\u003e developed groundbreaking enhancements to the human genome deep below the frigid surface of Jupiter's moon, Europa.\nstory-marcolian = The \u003cmarcolian\u003eMarcolians\u003c/marcolian\u003e, in pursuit of absolute supremacy, rose and promptly laid claim to the entire red planet of Mars.\nstory-augencore = The \u003caugencore\u003eAugencore\u003c/augencore\u003e found refuge on their foundry ship Caine-1, augmenting themselves for deep space survival.\nstory-shroud = The \u003cshroud\u003eShroud\u003c/shroud\u003e, a mysterious presence in the universe - whereabouts currently unknown.\nstory-paragraph-2 = For 10,000 years each Parallel would advance their way of life far beyond the constraints of Earth. New homes that were once considered fiction, became reality. However, at last, the spark that humankind had kindled on Earth those millennia ago has ignited into the unlimited power source that was promised, calling each Parallel back home. This energy-rich invitation brings new conflict, as each Parallel believes Earth is theirs to claim.\n\naugencore-summary = None have known the true harshness of space like those aboard CAINE-1. For thousands of years, the Augencore have used technology to shape their bodies into perfect machines, hardened by the unforgiving void.

Underground, they thrived, engineering their own bodies to adapt to any environment.

They return to Earth, hoping to find the key to their salvation.\nkathari-sign-off = Adapt and survive. Your many lives await.\nmarcolian-summary = Humanity has thrived upon the once red planet.

Humankind grew increasingly desperate to find an unlimited source of energy to rely upon. Brilliant minds around the world assembled for the sake of Earth's salvation. At a loss for alternatives, they began experimenting with fission augmented by anti-matter. In their haste, they unleashed catastrophe on an unprecedented scale. Fleeing certain death, the mass exodus of Earth began. This course led to the inception of five parallel streams.\nstory-earthen = The \u003cearthen\u003eEarthen\u003c/earthen\u003e, a civilization of those left behind, remained and cultivated a thriving society through patience and perseverance.\nstory-kathari = The \u003ckathari\u003eKathari\u003c/kathari\u003e developed groundbreaking enhancements to the human genome deep below the frigid surface of Jupiter's moon, Europa.\nstory-marcolian = The \u003cmarcolian\u003eMarcolians\u003c/marcolian\u003e, in pursuit of absolute supremacy, rose and promptly laid claim to the entire red planet of Mars.\nstory-augencore = The \u003caugencore\u003eAugencore\u003c/augencore\u003e found refuge on their foundry ship Caine-1, augmenting themselves for deep space survival.\nstory-shroud = The \u003cshroud\u003eShroud\u003c/shroud\u003e, a mysterious presence in the universe - whereabouts currently unknown.\nstory-paragraph-2 = For 10,000 years each Parallel would advance their way of life far beyond the constraints of Earth. New homes that were once considered fiction, became reality. However, at last, the spark that humankind had kindled on Earth those millennia ago has ignited into the unlimited power source that was promised, calling each Parallel back home. This energy-rich invitation brings new conflict, as each Parallel believes Earth is theirs to claim.\n\naugencore-summary = None have known the true harshness of space like those aboard CAINE-1.

Humankind grew increasingly desperate to find an unlimited source of energy to rely upon. Brilliant minds around the world assembled for the sake of Earth's salvation. At a loss for alternatives, they began experimenting with fission augmented by anti-matter. In their haste, they unleashed catastrophe on an unprecedented scale. Fleeing certain death, the mass exodus of Earth began. This course led to the inception of five parallel streams.\nstory-earthen = The \u003cearthen\u003eEarthen\u003c/earthen\u003e, a civilization of those left behind, remained and cultivated a thriving society through patience and perseverance.\nstory-kathari = The \u003ckathari\u003eKathari\u003c/kathari\u003e developed groundbreaking enhancements to the human genome deep below the frigid surface of Jupiter's moon, Europa.\nstory-marcolian = The \u003cmarcolian\u003eMarcolians\u003c/marcolian\u003e, in pursuit of absolute supremacy, rose and promptly laid claim to the entire red planet of Mars.\nstory-augencore = The \u003caugencore\u003eAugencore\u003c/augencore\u003e found refuge on their foundry ship Caine-1, augmenting themselves for deep space survival.\nstory-shroud = The \u003cshroud\u003eShroud\u003c/shroud\u003e, a mysterious presence in the universe - whereabouts currently unknown.\nstory-paragraph-2 = For 10,000 years each Parallel would advance their way of life far beyond the constraints of Earth. New homes that were once considered fiction, became reality. However, at last, the spark that humankind had kindled on Earth those millennia ago has ignited into the unlimited power source that was promised, calling each Parallel back home. This energy-rich invitation brings new conflict, as each Parallel believes Earth is theirs to claim.\n\naugencore-summary = None have known the true harshness of space like those aboard CAINE-1. For thousands of years, the Augencore have used technology to shape their bodies into perfect machines, hardened by the unforgiving void. With a dying engine, and news that Earth is once more habitable, the Augencore return to Earth, bolstered by the prospect of home.\naugencore-sign-off = Find what you can build yourself to be.\nearthen-summary = The events of The Priming changed the face of the Earth, and the faces of the Earth's stalwart inhabitants. Devoted to the teachings of their new leaders, the Earthen defend a changed world from those who would do it harm.\nearthen-sign-off = Listen to the call of your home.\nkathari-summary = The Kathari were born from necessity - a need to survive in the harsh and frozen depths of Europa. Underground, they thrived, engineering their own bodies to adapt to any environment. Now, after thousands of years of cloning and adaptations, the threat of genetic decay looms large and heavy over their heads. They return to Earth, hoping to find the key to their salvation.\nkathari-sign-off = Adapt and survive. Your many lives await.\nmarcolian-summary = Humanity has thrived upon the once red planet. Working as one, the Marcolians have turned desolate rock into a teeming metropolis of meticulous order and peerless technology. Having conquered Mars, they look to Earth as their next endeavour.\nmarcolian-sign-off = What is deservedly ours is ours to take.\nshroud-summary = Colonists aboard the ship known as the New Dawn set off to explore the unknown depths of space. They were enveloped in a black hole, coming out from the Singularity as something new to this universe. Now, serving a powerful entity from the Singularity known as The Great One, they operate in the shadows of space, preparing our solar system for the arrival of their enigmatic leader.\nshroud-sign-off = Ascension through the power of The Great One.\n","title-download = Download | Parallel\nplay-open-beta-for-free = Play open beta for free\ndont-have-parallel-account = I don\u0026apos;t have a Parallel account yet\nhave-parallel-account = I have a Parallel account\nalready-registered = Already registered?\ndownload-for-windows = Download for Windows\ndownload-from-parallel = Download from Parallel\ndownload-from-epic = Download from Epic\nplease-check-email-to-verify-account = Please check your email to verify account before playing\nplease-note-our-client-is-only-supported-on-windows-machines = Please note our client is only supported on Windows machines\nminimum-specs =  Min. specs - Windows 7 (64-bit version) - Intel Core i5-10400 @2.90 - 4 GB RAM Nvidia GeForce 1060 6GB - 4 GB available storage space - DirectX 12\ndownloading-parallel = Downloading Parallel\u003cdotDotDot\u003e\u003c/dotDotDot\u003e\ntry-again-downloading-parallel = If your download didn\u0026apos;t start. \u003ctryAgainLink\u003eTry again\u003c/tryAgainLink\u003e","title-download = Download | Parallel\nplay-open-beta-for-free = Play open beta for free\ndont-have-parallel-account = I don\u0026apos;t have a Parallel account yet\nhave-parallel-account = I have a Parallel account\nalready-registered = Already registered?\ndownload-for-windows = Download for Windows\ndownload-from-parallel = Download from Parallel\ndownload-from-epic = Download from Epic\nplease-check-email-to-verify-account = Please check your email to verify account before playing\nplease-note-our-client-is-only-supported-on-windows-machines = Please note our client is only supported on Windows machines\nminimum-specs =  Min. specs - Windows 7 (64-bit version) - Intel Core i5-10400 @2.90 - 4 GB RAM Nvidia GeForce 1060 6GB - 4 GB available storage space - DirectX 12\ndownloading-parallel = Downloading Parallel\u003cdotDotDot\u003e\u003c/dotDotDot\u003e\ntry-again-downloading-parallel = If your download didn\u0026apos;t start. \u003ctryAgainLink\u003eTry again\u003c/tryAgainLink\u003e","starter-decks-introducing = Introducing\nstarter-decks-title = Parallel \u003chighlight\u003eStarter Decks\u003c/highlight\u003e\nstarter-decks-description = Using cards from Starter Decks may help you earn \u003chighlight\u003ePRIME\u003c/highlight\u003e\n\nstarter-decks-base-balance-warning = Not enough ETH on Base\nstarter-decks-bridge-eth-btn = Bridge ETH\nstarter-decks-connect-wallet = Connect Wallet\n\nstarter-deck-label = Starter deck \u003cdecoration\u003e\u0026#9679;\u003c/decoration\u003e 40 cards\nstarter-decks-view-deck = View deck\nstarter-decks-sold-out = Sold out\nstarter-decks-you-pay = You pay\n\nstarter-decks-purchase-sum = {$count -\u003e\n    [one] {$count} Starter deck\n    *[other] {$count} Starter decks\n}\nstarter-decks-buy-btn = {$count -\u003e\n    [one] Buy Deck\n    *[other] Buy Decks\n}\nstarter-decks-buy-decks = Buy Decks\n\nstarter-decks-pending-payment = Payment in progress \u003cdotDotDot\u003e\u003c/dotDotDot\u003e\nstarter-decks-pending-description = Please stay on the page while your payment is completed.\nstarter-decks-transaction-id = Transaction ID\n\nstarter-decks-payment-success = Payment Successful\nstarter-decks-payment-success-description = Your starter decks are on their way!

Humankind grew increasingly desperate to find an unlimited source of energy to rely upon. Brilliant minds around the world assembled for the sake of Earth's salvation. At a loss for alternatives, they began experimenting with fission augmented by anti-matter. In their haste, they unleashed catastrophe on an unprecedented scale. Fleeing certain death, the mass exodus of Earth began. This course led to the inception of five parallel streams.\nstory-earthen = The \u003cearthen\u003eEarthen\u003c/earthen\u003e, a civilization of those left behind, remained and cultivated a thriving society through patience and perseverance.\nstory-kathari = The \u003ckathari\u003eKathari\u003c/kathari\u003e developed groundbreaking enhancements to the human genome deep below the frigid surface of Jupiter's moon, Europa.\nstory-marcolian = The \u003cmarcolian\u003eMarcolians\u003c/marcolian\u003e, in pursuit of absolute supremacy, rose and promptly laid claim to the entire red planet of Mars.\nstory-augencore = The \u003caugencore\u003eAugencore\u003c/augencore\u003e found refuge on their foundry ship Caine-1, augmenting themselves for deep space survival.\nstory-shroud = The \u003cshroud\u003eShroud\u003c/shroud\u003e, a mysterious presence in the universe - whereabouts currently unknown.\nstory-paragraph-2 = For 10,000 years each Parallel would advance their way of life far beyond the constraints of Earth. New homes that were once considered fiction, became reality. However, at last, the spark that humankind had kindled on Earth those millennia ago has ignited into the unlimited power source that was promised, calling each Parallel back home. This energy-rich invitation brings new conflict, as each Parallel believes Earth is theirs to claim.\n\naugencore-summary = None have known the true harshness of space like those aboard CAINE-1. For thousands of years, the Augencore have used technology to shape their bodies into perfect machines, hardened by the unforgiving void. With a dying engine, and news that Earth is once more habitable, the Augencore return to Earth, bolstered by the prospect of home.\naugencore-sign-off = Find what you can build yourself to be.\nearthen-summary = The events of The Priming changed the face of the Earth, and the faces of the Earth's stalwart inhabitants.

Underground, they thrived, engineering their own bodies to adapt to any environment. Now, after thousands of years of cloning and adaptations, the threat of genetic decay looms large and heavy over their heads. They return to Earth, hoping to find the key to their salvation.\nkathari-sign-off = Adapt and survive. Your many lives await.\nmarcolian-summary = Humanity has thrived upon the once red planet.

Humankind grew increasingly desperate to find an unlimited source of energy to rely upon. Brilliant minds around the world assembled for the sake of Earth's salvation. At a loss for alternatives, they began experimenting with fission augmented by anti-matter. In their haste, they unleashed catastrophe on an unprecedented scale. Fleeing certain death, the mass exodus of Earth began. This course led to the inception of five parallel streams.\nstory-earthen = The \u003cearthen\u003eEarthen\u003c/earthen\u003e, a civilization of those left behind, remained and cultivated a thriving society through patience and perseverance.\nstory-kathari = The \u003ckathari\u003eKathari\u003c/kathari\u003e developed groundbreaking enhancements to the human genome deep below the frigid surface of Jupiter's moon, Europa.\nstory-marcolian = The \u003cmarcolian\u003eMarcolians\u003c/marcolian\u003e, in pursuit of absolute supremacy, rose and promptly laid claim to the entire red planet of Mars.\nstory-augencore = The \u003caugencore\u003eAugencore\u003c/augencore\u003e found refuge on their foundry ship Caine-1, augmenting themselves for deep space survival.\nstory-shroud = The \u003cshroud\u003eShroud\u003c/shroud\u003e, a mysterious presence in the universe - whereabouts currently unknown.\nstory-paragraph-2 = For 10,000 years each Parallel would advance their way of life far beyond the constraints of Earth. New homes that were once considered fiction, became reality.

This energy-rich invitation brings new conflict, as each Parallel believes Earth is theirs to claim.\n\naugencore-summary = None have known the true harshness of space like those aboard CAINE-1.

Humankind grew increasingly desperate to find an unlimited source of energy to rely upon. Brilliant minds around the world assembled for the sake of Earth's salvation. At a loss for alternatives, they began experimenting with fission augmented by anti-matter. In their haste, they unleashed catastrophe on an unprecedented scale. Fleeing certain death, the mass exodus of Earth began. This course led to the inception of five parallel streams.\nstory-earthen = The \u003cearthen\u003eEarthen\u003c/earthen\u003e, a civilization of those left behind, remained and cultivated a thriving society through patience and perseverance.\nstory-kathari = The \u003ckathari\u003eKathari\u003c/kathari\u003e developed groundbreaking enhancements to the human genome deep below the frigid surface of Jupiter's moon, Europa.\nstory-marcolian = The \u003cmarcolian\u003eMarcolians\u003c/marcolian\u003e, in pursuit of absolute supremacy, rose and promptly laid claim to the entire red planet of Mars.\nstory-augencore = The \u003caugencore\u003eAugencore\u003c/augencore\u003e found refuge on their foundry ship Caine-1, augmenting themselves for deep space survival.\nstory-shroud = The \u003cshroud\u003eShroud\u003c/shroud\u003e, a mysterious presence in the universe - whereabouts currently unknown.\nstory-paragraph-2 = For 10,000 years each Parallel would advance their way of life far beyond the constraints of Earth. New homes that were once considered fiction, became reality. However, at last, the spark that humankind had kindled on Earth those millennia ago has ignited into the unlimited power source that was promised, calling each Parallel back home. This energy-rich invitation brings new conflict, as each Parallel believes Earth is theirs to claim.\n\naugencore-summary = None have known the true harshness of space like those aboard CAINE-1. For thousands of years, the Augencore have used technology to shape their bodies into perfect machines, hardened by the unforgiving void.

Underground, they thrived, engineering their own bodies to adapt to any environment. Now, after thousands of years of cloning and adaptations, the threat of genetic decay looms large and heavy over their heads.

Humankind grew increasingly desperate to find an unlimited source of energy to rely upon. Brilliant minds around the world assembled for the sake of Earth's salvation. At a loss for alternatives, they began experimenting with fission augmented by anti-matter. In their haste, they unleashed catastrophe on an unprecedented scale. Fleeing certain death, the mass exodus of Earth began. This course led to the inception of five parallel streams.\nstory-earthen = The \u003cearthen\u003eEarthen\u003c/earthen\u003e, a civilization of those left behind, remained and cultivated a thriving society through patience and perseverance.\nstory-kathari = The \u003ckathari\u003eKathari\u003c/kathari\u003e developed groundbreaking enhancements to the human genome deep below the frigid surface of Jupiter's moon, Europa.\nstory-marcolian = The \u003cmarcolian\u003eMarcolians\u003c/marcolian\u003e, in pursuit of absolute supremacy, rose and promptly laid claim to the entire red planet of Mars.\nstory-augencore = The \u003caugencore\u003eAugencore\u003c/augencore\u003e found refuge on their foundry ship Caine-1, augmenting themselves for deep space survival.\nstory-shroud = The \u003cshroud\u003eShroud\u003c/shroud\u003e, a mysterious presence in the universe - whereabouts currently unknown.\nstory-paragraph-2 = For 10,000 years each Parallel would advance their way of life far beyond the constraints of Earth. New homes that were once considered fiction, became reality. However, at last, the spark that humankind had kindled on Earth those millennia ago has ignited into the unlimited power source that was promised, calling each Parallel back home. This energy-rich invitation brings new conflict, as each Parallel believes Earth is theirs to claim.\n\naugencore-summary = None have known the true harshness of space like those aboard CAINE-1. For thousands of years, the Augencore have used technology to shape their bodies into perfect machines, hardened by the unforgiving void.

Underground, they thrived, engineering their own bodies to adapt to any environment. Now, after thousands of years of cloning and adaptations, the threat of genetic decay looms large and heavy over their heads. They return to Earth, hoping to find the key to their salvation.\nkathari-sign-off = Adapt and survive. Your many lives await.\nmarcolian-summary = Humanity has thrived upon the once red planet.

Humankind grew increasingly desperate to find an unlimited source of energy to rely upon. Brilliant minds around the world assembled for the sake of Earth's salvation. At a loss for alternatives, they began experimenting with fission augmented by anti-matter. In their haste, they unleashed catastrophe on an unprecedented scale. Fleeing certain death, the mass exodus of Earth began. This course led to the inception of five parallel streams.\nstory-earthen = The \u003cearthen\u003eEarthen\u003c/earthen\u003e, a civilization of those left behind, remained and cultivated a thriving society through patience and perseverance.\nstory-kathari = The \u003ckathari\u003eKathari\u003c/kathari\u003e developed groundbreaking enhancements to the human genome deep below the frigid surface of Jupiter's moon, Europa.\nstory-marcolian = The \u003cmarcolian\u003eMarcolians\u003c/marcolian\u003e, in pursuit of absolute supremacy, rose and promptly laid claim to the entire red planet of Mars.\nstory-augencore = The \u003caugencore\u003eAugencore\u003c/augencore\u003e found refuge on their foundry ship Caine-1, augmenting themselves for deep space survival.\nstory-shroud = The \u003cshroud\u003eShroud\u003c/shroud\u003e, a mysterious presence in the universe - whereabouts currently unknown.\nstory-paragraph-2 = For 10,000 years each Parallel would advance their way of life far beyond the constraints of Earth. New homes that were once considered fiction, became reality. However, at last, the spark that humankind had kindled on Earth those millennia ago has ignited into the unlimited power source that was promised, calling each Parallel back home. This energy-rich invitation brings new conflict, as each Parallel believes Earth is theirs to claim.\n\naugencore-summary = None have known the true harshness of space like those aboard CAINE-1. For thousands of years, the Augencore have used technology to shape their bodies into perfect machines, hardened by the unforgiving void. With a dying engine, and news that Earth is once more habitable, the Augencore return to Earth, bolstered by the prospect of home.\naugencore-sign-off = Find what you can build yourself to be.\nearthen-summary = The events of The Priming changed the face of the Earth, and the faces of the Earth's stalwart inhabitants. Devoted to the teachings of their new leaders, the Earthen defend a changed world from those who would do it harm.\nearthen-sign-off = Listen to the call of your home.\nkathari-summary = The Kathari were born from necessity - a need to survive in the harsh and frozen depths of Europa. Underground, they thrived, engineering their own bodies to adapt to any environment. Now, after thousands of years of cloning and adaptations, the threat of genetic decay looms large and heavy over their heads. They return to Earth, hoping to find the key to their salvation.\nkathari-sign-off = Adapt and survive. Your many lives await.\nmarcolian-summary = Humanity has thrived upon the once red planet. Working as one, the Marcolians have turned desolate rock into a teeming metropolis of meticulous order and peerless technology. Having conquered Mars, they look to Earth as their next endeavour.\nmarcolian-sign-off = What is deservedly ours is ours to take.\nshroud-summary = Colonists aboard the ship known as the New Dawn set off to explore the unknown depths of space. They were enveloped in a black hole, coming out from the Singularity as something new to this universe. Now, serving a powerful entity from the Singularity known as The Great One, they operate in the shadows of space, preparing our solar system for the arrival of their enigmatic leader.\nshroud-sign-off = Ascension through the power of The Great One.\n","artigraph-prime-approval-title = Prime Contract Approval\nartigraph-prime-approval-description = To proceed with Artigraph upgrade, please set a Prime Spend amount.

Humankind grew increasingly desperate to find an unlimited source of energy to rely upon. Brilliant minds around the world assembled for the sake of Earth's salvation. At a loss for alternatives, they began experimenting with fission augmented by anti-matter. In their haste, they unleashed catastrophe on an unprecedented scale. Fleeing certain death, the mass exodus of Earth began.

New homes that were once considered fiction, became reality. However, at last, the spark that humankind had kindled on Earth those millennia ago has ignited into the unlimited power source that was promised, calling each Parallel back home. This energy-rich invitation brings new conflict, as each Parallel believes Earth is theirs to claim.\n\naugencore-summary = None have known the true harshness of space like those aboard CAINE-1. For thousands of years, the Augencore have used technology to shape their bodies into perfect machines, hardened by the unforgiving void.
