# Blockchain Intelligence

## Mapping real-world entities to on-chain activity

Chainalysis delivers industry-leading blockchain intelligence by connecting
real-world entities to on-chain activity through sophisticated machine
learning, dedicated forensic experts, and an extensive customer network.

![](https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/blockchain-
intelligence-5.svg)

## 65,000+

unique entities identified

## 1 billion+

addresses clustered

## $11 billion+

in stolen funds we’ve helped recover

## 23

chains supported

Breadth Depth Accuracy Speed

## **BREADTH**

### Gain visibility into wallet ownership

#### Ground-truth attributions

Ground-truth attributions are collected with directly observable, verifiable
evidence demonstrating that an address belongs to a service. These
attributions are the initial focal point to begin mapping real-world entities
to on-chain addresses.

![](https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/bi-ground-truth-
attributions-2.svg)

#### Global intelligence

With the largest Global Intelligence Team in the industry, entities can be
attributed in difficult-to-access regions with the ability to hyper-focus in
specific areas such as sanctioned jurisdictions.

![](https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/bi-global-
intel.svg)

#### Chain and token support

Chainalysis has architected a flexible platform to scale blockchain and asset
support, leveraging generalized frameworks applicable to networks that are
alike in blockchain type. This enables quick integration with new chains,
inclusive of all tokens.

![](https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/bi-chain-token-
support.png)

#### Three key advantages

![](https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/icon-speed.svg)

##### Onboarding Speed

Generalized frameworks allow for fast integrations with new chains.

![](https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/icon-dynamic-
coin.svg)

##### Dynamic token support

For smart-contract based networks, Chainalysis supports all fungible and non-
fungible tokens.

![](https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/icon-
clustering.svg)

##### Clustering speed

Our architecture fast tracks clustering capabilities earlier in our pipeline
enabling us to begin deploying and iterating clustering heuristics for all
blockchains more quickly than ever before.

## Depth

### Gain a complete view of entity activity

#### Clustering heuristics

Tying ground-truth attributions to single addresses helps achieve breadth of
coverage, but this now necessitates the need for depth. It’s critical to
understand all addresses an entity controls through a process of clustering,
or grouping addresses together. As addresses are clustered, a deeper and more
complete mapping of all interactions between entities is created.

To gain this level of depth, learn about the different clustering heuristics
and the amount of rigor involved.

![](https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/bi-clustering-
heuristics-1.svg)

![](https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/icon-network.svg)

##### Network-wide Heuristics

Network wide heuristics are generic by nature and can be applied to any wallet
on a given UTXO or EVM blockchain.

![](https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/icon-building.svg)

##### Service-specific Heuristics

Service-specific heuristics are custom tailored for a specific entity’s
architecture. There are 100s of service-specific heuristics employed.

#### Advanced clustering

Chainalysis has built an architecture with the ability to experiment, deploy,
and iterate on clustering algorithms at a rapid pace. For example, with
dedicated data pipelines, we are able to scan billions of transactions in
order to identify unique patterns that power our heuristics for both UTXO-
based blockchains as well as account-based blockchains.

![](https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/bi-advanced-
clustering.svg)

## Accuracy

### Inaccurate data is worse than missing data

#### Data quality

Chainalysis is commonly asked “what is your false positive rate”? Determining
a false positive rate requires a source of truth to check against, and
Chainalysis is the industry’s source of truth. Still, there is supporting
evidence that speaks to data accuracy and quality.

![](https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/bi-data-
quality-1.svg)

#### Data validation

**Customers validate our clusters on a daily basis.**  
Many of the services (e.g. exchanges) whose addresses that are clustered are
also Chainalysis customers who use transaction monitoring services. As such,
those customers share thousands of addresses per day, allowing Chainalysis to
validate clustering accuracy. To date, there has never been a discrepancy
found between Chainalysis data and the addresses provided by customers.

**Public sector setting the industry standard.**  
A significant number of Chainalysis customers are law enforcement agencies,
regulators, and intelligence agencies at various levels. With that said, it’s
crucial to be using the same solutions and datasets that fellow agencies use.
Since 2014, the public sector has been a core clientele, and the reliability
of Chainalysis intelligence is pivotal for continuing these positive
partnerships.

![](https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/bi-data-
validation-1.svg)

## Speed

### Trace and discover insights quickly

#### Dynamic token support

We are able to support tokens deployed to a chain within seconds. Speed is
essential in this environment. For example, it’s important to ensure that
onramps and offramps are aware of which addresses should be blacklisted or
have funds frozen.

![](https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/bi-dynamic-token-
support-1.png)

#### Global intelligence obligations

Chainalysis has a Global Intelligence Team collecting ground-truth
attributions on a daily basis, who are obligated to submit those attributions
into the intelligence layer as soon as possible.

obligations-1.svg)
