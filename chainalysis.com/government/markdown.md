### A long, successful history

In landmark cases involving [terrorism financing
campaigns](https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/cryptocurrency-terrorism-
financing-al-qaeda-al-qassam-brigades-bitcointransfer/), [child abuse
material](https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/chainalysis-doj-welcome-to-video-
shutdown/), [darknet markets](https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/silk-road-doj-
seizure-november-2020/), [ransomware
gangs](https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/netwalker-ransomware-disruption-
arrest/), [North Korean hacking](https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/lazarus-
group-north-korea-doj-complaint-august-2020/), [Russian money laundering
operations](https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/ofac-sanction-suex-
september-2021/), and more, agencies have seized billions of dollars worth of
cryptocurrencies used in illicit activity. These successes demonstrate the
wide range of consumer protection and national security issues at play and the
growing sophistication of government agencies in blockchain analysis.

trust.jpg)

### Build trust in blockchains

When law enforcement, the intelligence community, and regulators become
comfortable with cryptocurrency, exchanges will grow, financial institutions
can enter the ecosystem safely and responsibly, and ultimately people will
have more financial freedom with less risk. This is one piece of a larger
strategy of deeper engagement with governments in the United States and around
the world.

We've collaborated with Chainalysis on a recent pig butchering case, where the
loss exceeded $1 million. We engaged directly with the Chainalysis
Investigations team, and not only were they able to trace through, but we were
also able to follow what they traced one more hop to a real-world known
entity, which we served legal process on."

Force, Connecticut State Police
