FAQ

WBETH & ETH Staking

BETH

1

What is ETH Staking?

The Ethereum network is a “Proof-of-Stake” network, where holders of ETH can
stake their ETH to secure the network and earn rewards. However, staking
directly through the Ethereum network requires at least 32 ETH, as well as
setting up and maintaining nodes.

Binance lowers the barriers by running the nodes for users and offering the
option to stake from as little as 0.0001 ETH to earn rewards. When you stake
ETH via Binance, you will get WBETH as the tokenized representation of your
staked ETH and rewards.

2

What is WBETH and what can I do with it?

Wrapped Beacon ETH (WBETH) represents your staked ETH plus the staking reward
received, in a tradable and transferable form.

Ordinary staking would lock up your staked assets, which means you cannot use
them for other purposes. It increases a user's opportunity cost.

In contrast, WBETH provides flexibility to sell, transfer, or use the staked
ETH position. You can even move WBETH to a personal wallet and use it outside
the Binance platform whilst still earning rewards.

WBETH accumulates the staking rewards, even when it is used in other Binance
products or external DeFi applications for additional yield opportunities.

For more use cases, please visit
[here](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/wbeth-use-
cases-c2edfefdad214259b984730a0cb760ec)

3

Why is APR changing and how is the APR calculated?

The ETH staking APR is dynamic, following the on-chain Ethereum staking
rewards which fluctuate due to various factors including on-chain activities
and consensus rewards, etc. A commission fee on the reward is charged to
ensure the product is sustainable. Rewards are distributed to Binance ETH
Staking users on a T+2 day basis after the rewards are generated on chain.

4

Why do I get less WBETH amount than the ETH amount I staked? Why is the
WBETH:ETH conversion ratio not 1:1?

Staking ETH into WBETH does not diminish your ETH balance. Both your ETH and
earned rewards can be reclaimed based on the applicable conversion ratio at
redemption.

The WBETH:ETH ratio is not 1:1 because 1 WBETH represents 1 staked ETH plus
the staking rewards since 2023-04-27 08:00 (UTC). Due to the accumulation of
staking rewards, the value of 1 WBETH progressively exceeds that of 1 ETH. The
ratio is updated daily to reflect the rewards earned from the staked ETH.

Example*:  
On 22 July 2023, the WBETH:ETH conversion ratio was 1:1.01004105. When a user
stakes 10 ETH, they would obtain 9.90058770 WBETH.

ETH staking rewards accumulate, and the user's WBETH becomes worth more ETH.
Three months later, on 23 October 2023, the WBETH:ETH conversion ratio has
grown to 1:1.01980774.

If the user redeems their WBETH on that day, they would receive 10.09669596
ETH, which includes both their staked amount and the earned rewards.

*The numbers above are for illustrative purposes only. The actual scenario depends on the conversion rate at stake/redeem, the holding period of WBETH, and on-chain ETH staking APR, etc.

5

How often does the WBETH:BETH conversion rate change/update?

Daily at 23:45 - 00:15 (UTC+0)  
  
Please note that staking/redemption feature is paused in the period when the
WBETH:BETH conversion rate is being updated.

6

Does the conversion ratio change linearly or variably?

WBETH will increase in value, which is reflected by every update of the
WBETH:BETH conversion ratio. However, the actual value increase in every
update is variable, depending on the on-chain ETH staking APR.

7

Do I get rewards accrued in WBETH bought from the market?

Yes, WBETH accrues rewards even if it was bought from the market, deposited to
an exchange, or obtained from Binance ETH Staking.

8

When and how will I receive my staking rewards?

Holding WBETH represents the staked ETH plus the staking rewards. No rewards
will be distributed to your Spot Wallet directly. Instead, the rewards earned
are accrued and increase the value of WBETH. This increased value is reflected
by the WBETH:ETH conversion ratio updated daily at 00:00 (UTC). You will be
able to check the records of your earned rewards value in ETH on the WBETH
Reward History of Binance ETH Staking page.

For BETH, the staking rewards will be distributed in the form of BETH to your
Spot Wallet on a daily basis between 04:00 to 10:00 (UTC).

9

Where can I view my staking balance?

Your staked ETH balance can be viewed after logging in to your Binance account
and navigating to this [Binance ETH Staking](/en/earn/ethereum-staking) page.

10

Where can I view my staking rewards records?

Your cumulative rewards can be viewed after logging in to your Binance account
and navigating to this [Binance ETH Staking](/en/earn/ethereum-staking).  
  
For BETH rewards, you can also check your ETH Staking History.

11

How can I redeem my staked ETH?

You can redeem your staked ETH for ETH on Binance ETH Staking.

WBETH holders can redeem their WBETH to ETH based on the applicable WBETH:ETH
conversion ratio at redemption.

BETH holders can redeem their BETH back to ETH at a 1:1 ratio.

Please note that there is a limit on the daily quota due to the processing
limitations on the Ethereum network. The redemption processing time may vary.
Please check on the redemption page for the delivery time.

12

Are there any restrictions on the number of staked ETH that I can redeem?

Yes. Due to the rate limit design of the Ethereum network, only a limited
amount of staked ETH can be unstaked daily. The redemption pool on Binance ETH
Staking is replenished based on the amount received from the network.

Hence, a daily staked ETH redemption quota will be set for each Binance user.
The personal quota is based on each user's past average holding of staked ETH
in Binance Spot Wallet, Funding Wallet, Earn Wallet, Binance Loan collateral
account, Margin Wallet, and Portfolio Margin account:

\- Past 15-day average holding < \-- staked ETH: max -- staked ETH per day

\- Past 15-day average holding >= -- staked ETH: max --% of your average
staked ETH holdings per day.

Your staked ETH holding = WBETH holding * WBETH:ETH conversion ratio + BETH
holding

Please carefully consider the uncertainty that if the on-chain daily quota is
used up, Binance cannot unstake the ETH from the network and, hence, you may
not be able to redeem your BETH for ETH until the quota is available again.
The personal daily quota may change without prior notice.

13

When does my personal daily quota of redemption reset?

Your personal daily quota of staked ETH redemption is reset at 00:00 (UTC).

14

When is the platform-wise Total Redemption Limit replenished?

Based on the amount of ETH that Binance unstakes from the network, the
redemption pool is replenished throughout the day to maintain a fair
distribution. The replenishment schedule and quota may vary to ensure a smooth
user experience. When redeeming, you will share the ETH amount from the pool
with other users.

15

If I redeem my WBETH or BETH to ETH, when will I receive the ETH?

You will receive the unstaked ETH in your Spot Wallet -- days after
successfully submitting a redemption request.

Please note that a queue for ETH redemption is expected. The time it takes to
process ETH withdrawal requests is determined by the demand for ETH staking
withdrawals at the time of the redemption request.

The waiting period is subject to change and without prior notice.

However, the change in waiting period is not retrospective but only applicable
for new requests upon the change, i.e. once a redemption request is submitted.
The time you receive your ETH is fixed and you can check the arrival time in
your transaction history.

Should you need to unwind your ETH staking position immediately, you can wrap
BETH to WBETH and trade WBETH on Binance Spot Market.

16

If I redeem my WBETH or BETH to ETH, will I still receive the daily rewards?

No, the portion of WBETH or BETH you redeem/sell will no longer be entitled to
receive daily rewards.

17

What happens if I sell/transfer my WBETH or BETH to someone else?

If you sell/transfer your WBETH or BETH, then your ownership of the staked ETH
and the corresponding rewards (rewards accrued and future rewards) are
transferred to the one who purchased it.

18

Once I confirm to start the redemption, can I stop it?

No, the redemption process is not reversible. However, you can restake or swap
the received ETH into WBETH afterwards.

1

What is BETH, and how does it work?

BETH is the representation of your staked ETH on a 1:1 basis. By holding BETH
in your Spot Wallet, you receive a staking reward in the form of BETH. You can
redeem your BETH holdings back to ETH on 1:1 basis. Please note that there are
limitations on the daily available quota of BETH that can be stake and redeem.

To transfer, trade, or utilize your ETH staking position for other use cases,
you may wrap your BETH into WBETH.

2

Will I keep receiving BETH staking rewards if I stake my BETH in other
products or platforms?

BETH staking rewards are calculated based on users' BETH positions in their
Binance Spot Wallet, so there are no more staking rewards if their BETH tokens
are deposited to other products or withdrawn out of Binance.

If you would like to keep receiving ETH staking rewards while holding or using
the assets out of Binance Spot Wallet, you may wrap BETH into WBETH here and
use WBETH for the purpose.

3

Why cannot I withdraw BETH from Binance?

BETH withdrawal from Binance is disabled since the launch of WBETH. Users who
would like to transfer the token off the platform can wrap it into WBETH on
the WBETH Wrap page.

Redemption of BETH for ETH is not affected.

4

Why would I wrap BETH to get WBETH and how can I use WBETH?

You will have to hold BETH in your Spot Wallet to receive staking rewards.

In contrast, WBETH accumulates the staking rewards, even when it is used in
other Binance products or external DeFi applications for additional yield
opportunities.

WBETH also provides flexibility to sell, transfer, or use the staked ETH
position. You can even move WBETH to a personal wallet and use it outside the
Binance platform.

cases-c2edfefdad214259b984730a0cb760ec)

5

Do I have to wrap my BETH into WBETH to keep receiving ETH staking rewards?

No, you will still receive a daily ETH staking reward distributed to your
Binance Spot Wallet by holding BETH, as long as you are following the rules
detailed on ETH Staking page. However, wrapping BETH into WBETH gives you
exclusive benefits that are covered in more depth in the answer to the
question "Why would I wrap BETH to get WBETH and how can I use WBETH?".

6

Why do I get less WBETH for my 1 BETH?

Wrapping does not diminish your staked ETH balance. Both your ETH and earned
rewards can be reclaimed based on the applicable conversion ratio at
redemption.

Each WBETH represents 1 BETH plus all of its accrued ETH staking rewards
starting from when WBETH's conversion rate was initialized on 27 Apr 2023
00:00 (UTC+0). The rewards for holding WBETH accrued in the value of WBETH. As
rewards are paid on the underlying staked ETH, the WBETH price denominated in
BETH (conversion rate) will increase over time. Each WBETH will be worth more
BETH.

Consequently, the WBETH price denominated in BETH is always larger than 1.
That is why when you convert 1 BETH to WBETH, you will get less WBETH.

Example*:  
On 22 July 2023, the WBETH:ETH conversion ratio was 1:1.01004105. When a user
wraps 10 BETH, they would obtain 9.90058770 WBETH.

ETH staking rewards accumulate, and the user's WBETH becomes worth more ETH.
Three months later, on 23 August 2023, the WBETH:ETH conversion ratio has
grown to 1:1.01980774.

If the user redeems their WBETH on that day, they would receive 10.09669596
ETH, which includes both their staked amount and the earned rewards.

*The numbers above are for illustrative purposes only. The actual scenario depends on the conversion rate at stake/redeem, the holding period of WBETH, and on-chain ETH staking APR, etc.

7

I do not see ETH staking rewards distributed to my Spot Wallet since I wrap
BETH to WBETH. Why?

WBETH gets staking rewards at the same rate as regular BETH.

However, the daily staking reward will not be distributed to your Binance Spot
Wallet as BETH. Instead, the rewards will accumulate and auto-compound inside
WBETH.

The WBETH:ETH conversion ratio is updated daily to reflect the rewards earned
from the staked ETH.

Once your WBETH is redeemed, the ETH amount you get back will be more than the
pre-wrapped amount, which reflects the reward you received.

8

Are there any charges for the wrapping process?

No, users can wrap for free.

9

What is the additional risk for holding WBETH than BETH?

Please make sure you are interacting with the correct smart contract address
when you transfer/trade WBETH outside of Binance’s platform. Anyone can create
a token and name it with the same symbol on-chain. Please find the correct
contract addresses on
[Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/token/0xa2E3356610840701BDf5611a53974510Ae27E2e1
) and
[BscScan](https://bscscan.com/token/0xa2E3356610840701BDf5611a53974510Ae27E2e1)

Secondary markets may price WBETH differently from the underlying WBETH:ETH
conversion ratio on Binance, which could mean that you lose/earn some cash
value if you wrap and then arbitrage your WBETH on the market. Please take
risk into consideration. Alternatively, when you would like to exit your WBETH
position, you may redeem it for the underlying ETH for free on Binance.
