Virtual currencies, real risks. The only guarantee in crypto is risk.  
Warning  
• The value of your virtual currencies can rise or fall sharply, and your
initial investment may be lost completely;  
• Virtual currencies are not covered by the guarantee funds that cover bank
deposits;  
• There is no legal mechanism on the virtual currencies market to prevent
market manipulation or insider dealing;  
• Virtual currencies depend entirely on a specific computer technology and
infrastructure, which in certain cases may be very recent and net yet
adequately tested;  
• If one loses the identification code or password giving access to the
virtual wallet in which the virtual currency is stored, the currency held
therein will be irretrievably lost;  
• Virtual currencies are currently accepted as a means of payment to a limited
extent, and in most countries there is no legal obligation to accept them;  
• For more information about the risks associated with an investment in virtual currencies, we advise you to read the Wikifin page [What is a cryptocurrency? | Wikifin](https://www.wikifin.be/nl/sparen-en-beleggen/beleggingsproducten/andere-beleggingsproducten/wat-een-cryptomunt).

[WHICH TYPE OF BUYER ARE YOU???  
  
👉Option A: Purchases an asset after it has already increased by 30-50%, driven
by the excitement and momentum of a significant price surge? This approach
often involves jumping into the market after a substantial upward move,
potentially capitalizing on the continued bullish trend but also running the
risk of buying at or near a peak.  
  
👉Option B: Prefers to wait for a retracement, buying the asset when it retests
its previous high or when it finds support at a significant macro trend level?
This strategy focuses on patience and timing, aiming to enter the market at a
more stable point after the initial excitement has subsided, potentially
leading to a more favorable risk-to-reward ratio.  
  
Please share your investment approach and explain your rationale behind it.

[4 tips provided by Binance to choose the right currency!!  
These are the 4 most important tips in analyzing any digital currency.  
  
1⃣ Economics - Tokenomics:  
Studying the economics of the currency, especially the increase in the supply
of the currency, is very important.  
Binance Research confirms that increasing the number of currencies without
increasing demand for these currencies leads to selling pressure that drives
the price down significantly.  
  
2⃣ Evaluation:  
The market value of the project does not comprehensively explain the success
of the project.  
The currency must be treated as a commercial project and the project's
performance should be compared in terms of the revenues it achieved and the
total value reserved.  
Sometimes the market value is severely exaggerated compared to what the
project achieves in terms of revenues, trading volume, etc.  
  
‏3⃣ Product :  
You should study the product that this project offers and the stage it has
reached.  
Is the project just an idea that was not implemented, or has the project
already launched a product?  
If it is launched, what are the indicators of its success in the market in
terms of number of users, profits, etc.?  
  
4⃣ People:  
Knowing who is behind the project and what their contribution to the project
is is a very important element in determining a successful project.  
Not only that, but knowing how the community interacts with the project’s
products is very important.  
  
Sometimes the community that owns the project is based solely on momentum
without any interest in the project's products.

About BNB

BNB is a cryptocurrency that can be used to trade and pay fees on the Binance
cryptocurrency exchange. BNB is also the cryptocurrency coin that powers the
BNB Chain ecosystem. As one of the world's most popular utility tokens, BNB is
useful to users in a wide range of applications and use cases.

BNB was launched through an [Initial Coin
Offering](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-an-ico) (or ICO)
that took place from June 26th to July 3rd, 2017 - 11 days before the Binance
Exchange opened for trading. The issue price was 1 ETH for 2,700 BNB or 1 BTC
for 20,000 BNB. Although BNB was launched through an ICO, BNB does not provide
users with a claim on Binance profits and does not represent an investment in
Binance.  

With various applications both within the BNB Chain ecosystem and beyond, BNB
serves numerous purposes. Originally launched as an ERC-20 token on the
Ethereum blockchain, BNB has now migrated to the main BNB Chain. Although the
initial total supply was set at 200 million coins, the supply is gradually
decreasing as a result of frequent coin burns. The current price of BNB is
updated and available in real-time on Binance.
