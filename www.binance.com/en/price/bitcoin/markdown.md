[Michael Saylor's Bitcoin Message Resonates Amid BTC Price UncertaintyMichael
Saylor, the chairman of MicroStrategy and a prominent BTC advocate, has issued
a Bitcoin message that resonates with the crypto community.  
  
In a tweet, Saylor wrote, "shockwaves of change" while tagging Bitcoin. The
MicroStrategy founder's call to recognize the revolutionary nature of Bitcoin
comes at a crucial moment, as the market grapples with uncertainty following a
massive move of Mt. Gox-era Bitcoins.  
  
Shockwaves of Change. [#Bitcoin](/en/square/hashtag?q=Bitcoin)
pic.twitter.com/GffiNobt24  
  
— Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) May 28, 2024  
  
According to Whale Alert data, over 140,000 BTC, worth approximately $9
billion, were moved from Mt. Gox wallets to an unknown wallet address in 13
transactions, possibly as part of a repayment arrangement for creditors.  
  
The market reacted unfavorably to the BTC transfers, with Bitcoin falling as
low as $67,437 after reaching a high of $70,613 on Monday. At the time of
writing, Bitcoin had slightly recouped its losses, down 0.45% in the last 24
hours to $68,280.  
  
card  
  
Mt. Gox, previously the world's largest Bitcoin exchange, shut down in 2014
when it was revealed that it had lost hundreds of thousands of Bitcoins in a
hack. Creditors have since expected the repayment of their assets, which is
widely expected to add selling pressure to Bitcoin markets.  
  
Over $9.4 billion worth of Bitcoin is owed to some of Mt. Gox’s 127,000
creditors, with a final repayment deadline of Oct. 31, 2024. In January, the
trustee began contacting creditors to establish their identities and swap
accounts for repayment.  
  
As the Bitcoin community grapples with these developments, the overarching
theme is one of change — both disruptive and transformative. Saylor's message
represents resilience amid uncertainty in the face of the unfolding Mt. Gox
event.  
  
This statement might also be a testament to the fact that even as the market
faces uncertainty, the underlying belief in the transformative potential of
Bitcoin remains a constant beacon for
many.](https://www.binance.com/en/square/post/8711947555849)

About Bitcoin (BTC)

Bitcoin is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the market. First
introduced in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin continues to the [top
cryptocurrency](https://www.binance.com/en/price) according to market
capitalization. Bitcoin paved the way for many existing altcoins in the market
and marked a pivotal moment for digital payment solutions.  
    
 As the world’s first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has come a long way in terms of
its value. However, one does not have to buy an entire bitcoin as bitcoins can
be divided into small units called satoshis, named after the creator. A
satoshi is equivalent to 0.00000001 bitcoin.  
    
 There is no physical BTC token so Bitcoin operates as a digital currency.
Bitcoin transactions are fully transparent and can’t be censored, providing a
global, censorship-resistant medium for financial exchange. It’s a financial
system backed by decentralized network of computers, known as ‘nodes’, instead
of  centralized banking or governmental entity, thereby promoting
‘decentralization’.

### Why Is the Bitcoin Price So Volatile?

The price of Bitcoin has been highly volatile since it started because of
several factors. Firstly, the crypto market is smaller and not heavily traded
like traditional markets, so big trades can make the price swing
substantially. Secondly, Bitcoin's value depends on public sentiment and
speculation, leading to short-term price changes. Media coverage, influential
opinions, and regulatory developments create uncertainty, affecting demand and
supply dynamics and contributing to price fluctuations.

Another key factor is Bitcoin's fixed supply. With only 21 million bitcoins
ever to be minted, its scarcity can lead to dramatic price changes as demand
varies. This is exacerbated by "whales" or large holders of Bitcoin, whose
sizable transactions can sway the market considerably.

### When Was Bitcoin Created?

Bitcoin was created in 2009 by an unknown person or group of people using the
pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. The digital asset is based on a decentralized,
peer-to-peer network and blockchain technology, allowing users to securely and
anonymously send and receive transactions without intermediaries. Satoshi
Nakamoto released the Bitcoin whitepaper in 2008, outlining the design and
principles of the cryptocurrency. The first Bitcoin transaction, which
involved sending 10 bitcoins to a developer, took place on January 12, 2009.
Since then, Bitcoin has gained traction as an alternative store of value and
payment system, transforming the financial industry.

### How Does Bitcoin Work?

Bitcoin runs on a decentralized, peer-to-peer network, making it possible for
individuals to conduct transactions without intermediaries. Transactions are
transparent and secure thanks to the underlying blockchain technology, which
stores and verifies recorded transaction data. Miners validate transactions by
solving complex mathematical problems with computational power. The first
miner to find the solution receives a cryptocurrency reward, thus creating new
bitcoins. Upon validation, the data is added to the existing blockchain, and
it becomes a permanent record. Bitcoin provides an alternative way to transact
that's transparent and secure, redefining traditional finance.

### When Is the Next Bitcoin Halving?

The fourth Bitcoin halving was completed on April 2024. It is difficult to
predict the exact date of the next halving as it depends on the block height.
Since halving happens every 210,000 blocks, the next Bitcoin halving is
expected to occur in 2028.

[Bitcoin halving](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/bitcoin-halving-
date-what-happens-to-your-bitcoin-after-the-halving) occurs approximately
every four years, where the rewards given to Bitcoin miners for mining blocks
are cut in half. Following the halving in April 2024, the reward was cut down
to 3.125 BTC per block. Halving was built into the Bitcoin protocol to
maintain its value as a deflationary currency.

### Does Bitcoin Halving Affect BTC’s Price?

The price movement following the fourth Bitcoin Halving hasn’t been dramatic
so far. Analysts believe that the cryptocurrency market is much more mature
today than in previous halvings. The current economic conditions could also be
a reason for no volatile price movements.

Other factors such as market sentiment, regulatory developments, and global
events can also impact the price of Bitcoin. Follow our [Bitcoin Halving
Countdown](https://www.binance.com/en/events/bitcoin-halving) to know how
Bitcoin halving works.
