[XRP Cryptocurrency May Face Turbulence in JuneAccording to U.Today, the
cryptocurrency XRP, which saw a 7% rise in May, might experience potential
instability in June. In May, XRP surpassed the significant psychological
threshold of $0.5 and maintained its stability, causing frustration among
investors who were anticipating more substantial price fluctuations. Despite
the performance in May aligning with the token's historical average gain of
27.7%, June might not yield the same positive returns.  
  
Historically, June has not been a favorable month for XRP. Over a decade of
data shows that the average return for June is -5.59% and the median return is
-8.92%. This indicates a probable downturn for XRP in the upcoming month. As
per CryptoRank, the last profitable June for XRP was in 2017, with all
subsequent Junes ending with losses of at least 8.15%.  
  
While the cryptocurrency market is known for its unpredictability, the
historical data for XRP provides a significant sample due to its status as one
of the oldest tokens on the market. Investors are advised to be cautious as
patterns over the years suggest a high likelihood of negative returns in June.  
  
The stability that XRP demonstrated in May, despite the absence of strong
swings, is now in stark contrast to the less optimistic forecast for June. If
historical trends persist, XRP bulls might find themselves disappointed as the
token could face a decline.  
  
While the market awaits the results, the reliability of the XRP price history
remains questionable. Whether historical patterns will continue in June is yet
to be seen, but the data suggests that investors hoping for growth in the
first month of summer should exercise
caution.](https://www.binance.com/en/square/post/8656268942913)

[XRP Whale Sends 32 Million Coins to Bitstamp Amid Lawsuit SagaA renowned XRP
whale has begun the new week on a high note, moving a massive 32 million coins
from a blockchain wallet to a centralized crypto exchange. This recent
transaction comes amid the ongoing legal case between Ripple and the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC recently opposed Ripple‚Äôs motion
to seal remedies-related documents, adding another layer to the saga between
both entities.  
  
Against the backdrop of this development, this whale has shifted a significant
amount of the XRP coin, raising speculations among investors and market
participants who are closely watching the price reaction of the coin following
this. Let us take a closer look at it.  
  
Popular Whale Shifts 32 Million XRP  
  
WhaleAlert, a large cryptocurrency transaction tracker, has drawn our
attention to a transaction involving a massive amount of XRP coins in the last
24 hours. According to the data, the whale moved exactly 31,800,000 XRP (worth
$16,870,003) from a wallet initially identified as ‚Äòunknown‚Äô to the CEX
Bitstamp. However, upon further check, it was found that the wallet associated
with this transaction was the notable address r4wf7‚Ä¶4Rzn.  
  
31,800,000 [#XRP](/en/square/hashtag?q=XRP) (16,870,003 USD) transferred from
unknown wallet to
[#Bitstamphttps](/en/square/hashtag?q=Bitstamphttps)://t.co/zUGkBj87A2  
  
‚Äî Whale Alert (@whale_alert) May 26, 2024  
  
This wallet address has been involved in huge XRP transactions for a couple of
months now, sparking discussions and guesses about the entity behind it.
Particularly, the Luxembourg-based crypto exchange Bitstamp has received
significant amounts of XRP coins since the blockchain giant Ripple acquired an
undisclosed stake in the company.  
  
Meanwhile, in the court case between Ripple and the SEC, It‚Äôs also important
to note that in the remedies briefing before Judge Torres, the U.S. SEC filed
a response opposing Ripple‚Äôs move to seal important documents. All of these
changes have further enhanced the mystery around the purpose of the XRP whale
transaction.  
  
XRP Price Movement Amid Massive Dump  
  
The price of XRP has suffered a notable drop following the 32 million dumped
by the whale. According to CoinMarketCap data, XRP has declined by 2.16% to
trade at $0.52 in the last 24 hours. However, its trading volume has surged by
20% within the recorded time to $735 million with a live market cap of $29.2
billion.  
  
Source: CoinMarketCap  
  
What is more, the volume of derivatives traded fell 3.79% to $526.51 million,
while XRP‚Äôs Futures Open Interest decreased by 0.26% to $617.99 million. This
demonstrates the declining interest of investors in the asset. Finally, XRP
has traded between the range of $0.5243 and $0.5395 over the last day.

[Bitcoin (BTC) Price Consolidation, Ethereum (ETH) Predictions After ETF
Approvals, and More: Bits...TL;DR  
  
BTC experienced volatility last week but calmed and currently sits around
$68,500, with some analysts forecasting new ATHs.  
  
Despite a brief drop, ETH has rebounded and is trading above $3,900, a 36%
increase over two weeks. Analysts anticipate further rallies, especially if
the asset maintains momentum above key levels.  
  
XRP may also head north, influenced by technical indicators and ongoing legal
proceedings with the SEC.  
  
How‚Äôs BTC Doing?  
  
The primary cryptocurrency experienced enhanced volatility in the past few
weeks, rising from around $61,000 on May 14 to over $71,000 on May 21. The
rally was stopped by a price correction, which pushed the asset below the $67K
mark on May 24. Shortly after, though, BTC reclaimed some lost ground and has
been trading in the $68,500-$69,300 area since then.  
  
BTC Price, Source: CoinGecko  
  
Despite the ongoing stagnation, numerous analysts believe the asset remains in
a bullish mode, expecting substantial gains in the near future. One example is
the X user Titan of Crypto who argued that a ‚Äúbreakout‚Äù is incoming once BTC
surpassed the resistance zone of around $69,000.  
  
Prior to that, the analyst analyzed Fibonacci extensions on the asset‚Äôs price
chart to predict a new all-time high in the range of $173,000 to $224,000.  
  
Such extensions are specific tools used in technical analysis to forecast
potential future value targets based on the Fibonacci sequence. They could
help traders identify key levels to watch for possible price swings, thereby
aiding in better decision-making.  
  
What About ETH?  
  
The second-largest digital asset in terms of market capitalization ‚Äì Ethereum
‚Äì has become one of the hottest topics in the cryptocurrency space recently.
Its price jumped from $3,100 on May 21 to over $3,900 on May 23 after
reemerged hopes that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) may approve spot ETH ETFs.  
  
The official green light occurred on May 24, following which the asset‚Äôs value
plunged below $3,700. Nonetheless, the bulls stepped in over the weekend, with
ETH currently trading at approximately $3,910 (per CoinGecko‚Äôs data), a 4%
daily increase and a 36% rise over two weeks.  
  
Many analysts believe the asset‚Äôs price is yet to start a substantial rally.
The X user Rekt Capital noted that ETH ‚Äúspent plenty of time‚Äù around the
$2,791 level, which historically has led to an uptick towards $4,000. The
analyst outlined their prediction on May 26, arguing that a weekly close in
the $3,250-$3,500 range ‚Äúwill confirm that bulls have reclaimed momentum.‚Äù
Recall that ETH closed the week well above the depicted level.  
  
XRP Price Outlook  
  
Ripple‚Äôs native cryptocurrency has also witnessed some price volatility in the
past week, hovering between $0.50 and $0.54, currently standing at around
$0.52 (CoinGecko‚Äôs data).  
  
While the asset is up a mere 2% on a 30-day scale, multiple analysts
anticipate a bull run in the following months. One example is JAVON MARKS, who
suggested that a bullish breakout is in the cards due to XRP nearing ‚Äúa major
converging point‚Äù and ‚Äúan RSI Pattern that is currently indicating underlying
momentum in prices.‚Äù  
  
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is an indicator measuring the speed and
change of price movements. An RSI above 70 signals that the coin could be
overbought and due for a price correction. Latest data shows that the ratio
has been on a downfall in the last week, currently pointing at 41.  
  
One essential element that may also affect the price of XRP is a possible
resolution of the lawsuit between Ripple and the US SEC. The legal battle has
been ongoing for over three years, with the case entering a trial phase last
month. Those curious to learn more about it and the potential impact on the
asset‚Äôs price, feel free to watch our dedicated video below:

About Ripple (XRP)

Ripple (XRP) is a decentralized payment network that was built to replace the
traditional money transfer network, SWIFT. Ripple is a uniquely designed
blockchain that works on a consensus model in which all nodes given access to
the system must validate transactions on the network. This model ensures that
payments on the network are subject to considerable security measures without
compromised efficiency. Transactions on Ripple are typically completed within
four to five seconds, much faster than some on other independent blockchain
networks that use different protocols. XRP price is updated live on Binance.

The Ripple network is powered by its native cryptocurrency, XRP. A fractional
.00001 XRP is charged for every transaction processed on the underlying XRP
Ledger (XRPL). Another interesting feature of XRP is that miners receive their
validation fees from the aforementioned charge, as all XRP coins were placed
into circulation when the network was first launched. This makes Ripple stand
out in the cryptocurrency industry, and such factors can affect XRP price.

XRP also functions as an intermediary on the XRPL network, which is able to
swap digital and fiat currencies through its network DeFi protocol. This means
XRP is used in the processing of digital and fiat currency transfers on XRPL
network. When XRPL was originally engineered in 2012 by Jed McCaleb, Arthur
Britto and David Schwartz prior to the formation of the blockchain company,
the idea was for Ripple to be a global payment network that would offer a
better solution than the traditional banking and financial systems in place.
Ripple Labs worked to enhance global payment capabilities, rather than to
replace the old system.

In February 2023, XRP Ledger (XRPL) developers unveiled a proposal for a
cross-chain bridge they believe would expand the blockchain's functionality.
The live price of XRP is updated and available in real time on Binance.

### SEC Vs Ripple Update: XRP Partially Wins Lawsuit Against SEC

In July 2023, Ripple achieved a partial victory in its legal battle against
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The court determined that
the sale of Ripple's XRP tokens through exchanges and algorithms did not
qualify as investment contracts.

However, the court concluded that Ripple's institutional sales of XRP were
indeed an unregistered securities offering. This ruling establishes a
precedent that could impact other cryptocurrencies, including Solana (SOL),
Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), and other tokens facing similar allegations of
being unregistered securities.

The decision highlights the evolving regulatory landscape surrounding
cryptocurrencies and the potential implications for their classification in
the future.

Despite a suit brought about by the US Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) in 2020, Ripple has maintained its position among the top 10
cryptocurrencies by volume.

People Also Ask: Other Questions About XRP

  1. ### 

What is Ripple (XRP)?

The term XRP comes from the standard of three-digit currency codes being used
to label individual currencies, such as USD for the US dollar, EUR for the
Euro, and GBP for the British pound. In this case, XRP refers to  any
interchangeable (X) currency, represented by RP or Ripple on the blockchain
network. Essentially, any currency (X) can be swapped on the XRP network by
using Ripple (RP) as an exchange medium.

  2. ### 

What is the All-Time High and All-Time Low of Ripple (XRP)?

On January 4, 2018, XRP achieved its highest price point of all time, reaching
$3.92 in trading value. XRP‚Äôs lowest recorded price was recorded on July 7,
2014, when it was valued at $0.002802.

  3. ### 

How does Ripple (XRP) work?

XRP is a digital currency that operates on a distributed ledger system. Unlike
traditional blockchain technology, it utilizes a different distributed ledger
system to facilitate the transfer of tokens representing various units of
value. XRP's open-source protocol allows anyone to access it without prior
approval, providing banks and non-bank actors with the ability to integrate
the Ripple protocol into their own systems. As per the team, XRP's technology
has the potential to transform the way we transfer value and could become a
vital tool for businesses seeking to streamline their payment processes.

  4. ### 

What is Ripple (XRP) Used For?

XRP is a cryptocurrency that was designed to facilitate cross-border
transactions quickly and cost-effectively. It is the native digital asset of
the Ripple network, which is a real-time gross settlement system and currency
exchange.

As a ‚Äòpayment currency‚Äô, XRP facilitates the swapping of a wide variety of
digital and physical currencies on the Ripple blockchain and decentralized
ledger.

Among XRP's key advantages are its speed. Transactions on the Ripple network,
as per the team, can be processed in just a few seconds. In addition, XRP
claims to offer lower transaction fees compared to traditional financial
systems. This is because the Ripple network operates on a decentralized
system, which eliminates the need for intermediaries like banks or payment
processors.

  5. ### 

Who are the Founders of Ripple (XRP)?

XRP was developed in 2011 when three engineers ‚Äî David Schwartz, Jed McCaleb
and Arthur Britto ‚Äî fascinated by Bitcoin, set out to create a more
sustainable digital network to be used for payments and global transactions.

Subsequently, the XRPL was born and shortly after, in June 2012, the network
was launched. The company NewCoin was formed a few months later, after which
it was renamed OpenCoin. Finally, the cryptocurrency project was renamed
Ripple in 2015.

  6. ### 

How Does Reward Validation Work on Ripple (XRP)?

Since all 100 billion XRP coins were released into circulation upon the launch
of Ripple‚Äôs mainnet, network validation fees are paid to validators on the
network by charging a small portion (.00001) of XRP, which is paid out
directly from the transactors during the process.

  7. ### 

What is the Maximum Token Supply of Ripple (XRP)?

The total maximum supply of XRP is set at 100 billion. However, with every XRP
transaction, a small percentage of the token is also burned, further lowering
the total remaining circulating supply. At the time of writing, there are over
51 billion XRP tokens in circulation.

  8. ### 

What Makes Ripple (XRP) Different From Others?

While the XRPL system is decentralized, Ripple uses a private system of bank-
governed servers to facilitate transactions on its network. Between this and
the centralized consensus method ‚Äî which requires all nodes to reach a
combined consensus ‚Äî security is heightened on the XRPL, while speed remains
fast and cost low.

The XRP Ledger is a payment platform that offers various use cases including
micropayments, DeFi, and NFTs. It supports developers with Python, Java, and
JavaScript, and provides flexibility and utility to enterprises. XRP Ledger's
website offers developers tutorials on various coding languages, app
development, and account management. The platform is used to create solutions
for inefficiencies in remittance and asset tokenization. The five primary use
cases of XRP Ledger are payments, tokenization, DeFi, CBDCs, and stablecoins.

  9. ### 

Did Ripple (XRP) Win the Lawsuit Against the SEC?

On July 13, 2023, Ripple achieved a partial  victory in its ongoing lawsuit
against the SEC. A U.S. court ruled that a substantial portion of the sales
and distributions of the cryptocurrency XRP do not meet the definition of
securities, contrary to the SEC's allegations in their 2020 civil lawsuit.
However, the court also ruled the SEC's claims regarding Ripple's alleged
violation of securities laws through the sale of XRP to institutional
investors to proceed to trial. This ruling, though a partial win for XRP,
underscores the importance of the upcoming trial in shaping the future of the
cryptocurrency industry.
