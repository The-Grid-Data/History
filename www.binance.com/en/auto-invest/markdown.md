## FAQ

1. What is Auto-Invest?

Auto-Invest allows you to automate crypto investments and grow your crypto
holdings. It is a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy. You can choose the
cryptocurrencies you want to purchase on a regular basis.

You can choose to create a [Single Token] plan for a single cryptocurrency, or
create a [Portfolio] plan to buy multiple cryptocurrencies in one portfolio.
Additionally, you can create an [Index-Linked plan] if the service is offered
to you in your local jurisdictions, find out more below at What is the Auto-
Invest Index-Linked Plan?

In some jurisdictions, your purchased BNB will be automatically deposited into
BNB Vault, and the other crypto purchased will be deposited to your Simple
Earn Flexible Products account, so you can grow your crypto holdings.

2. What cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and fiat currencies are offered on Auto-Invest?

For the full set of cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and fiat currencies
supported, explore our products or visit our [official FAQ](/support/faq/what-
is-auto-invest-and-how-to-use-it-3dd41bc1d4ea4879863ffbf2211a17fe).

3. How does Auto-Invest work?

Step 1 - Choose the crypto you want to buy or a [Multi Assets] purchase.

Step 2 - Choose how much you want to buy and select your preferred payment
method - stablecoins, fiat currencies or cryptos that are allowed for
subscriptions.

Step 3 - Select a Payment Order. You can also choose to enable the [Simple
Earn Wallet] option. Once enabled, if your Spot Wallet balance is
insufficient, the system will automatically redeem the assets from your
balance in Simple Earn Flexible Products to complete the purchase.

Step 4 - Select a Recurring cycle on how often you want to buy crypto or One-
Time purchase.

Step 5 - Invest

4. What is the difference between a Recurring vs One-Time transaction?

One-Time purchase: Allows you to subscribe to a cryptocurrency, portfolio and
index-linked plan once in real-time

Recurring Purchase: Allows you to subscribe to a cryptocurrency, portfolio and
index-linked plan on an hourly, 4-hourly, 8-hourly, 12-hourly,daily, weekly,
bi-weekly, or monthly basis.

5. Where are my Auto-Invest assets?

Single Token and Portfolio Assets

Your purchased BNB will be automatically deposited into the BNB Vault, and the
other crypto purchased will be deposited to your Simple Earn Flexible Products
account. You can redeem your crypto anytime from [Wallet] - [Earn]. Scroll to
the asset you want to redeem and click [Redeem]. The rewards you earn will be
in accordance with the [Simple Earn Terms of Service](/support/faq/binance-
simple-earn-terms-conditions-bc5978ba2ac2456cbb91d13860d36134).

In some jurisdictions and circumstances, these digital assets will be
transferred to your Spot Wallet and will not earn Simple Earn Flexible
rewards. These include but are not limited to:

•When the Simple Earn Flexible Products quota is sold out.

•When Simple Earn Flexible Products are not available in your region.

•When the crypto is offered on Auto-Invest and not Simple Earn Flexible
Products.

Index-Linked Plan Assets

Cryptocurrencies purchased through Index-Linked Plan will be retained within
the Auto-Invest account, and will not be deposited into the Simple Earn
Flexible Products account. They do not generate Simple Earn Rewards. Please
click [Go to Wallet] on the Auto-Invest Homepage to check your purchased
cryptocurrencies.

6. What happens to my Auto-Invest purchase when I don’t have sufficient balance in my Spot Wallet?

If you have enabled the [Simple Earn Wallet Balance] option and the balance in
your Spot Wallet is insufficient to cover the Auto-Invest plan purchase, the
system will automatically redeem the assets from your Simple Earn Flexible
Products account to complete the purchase.

If you don't enable the function, the purchase will fail. The system will try
to make another purchase on the next Auto-Invest date.

7. How many Auto-Invest plans can I subscribe to?

There is a maximum limit of 100 Auto-Invest plans that you can subscribe to.
This applies to all plans under My Portfolio & My Index-Linked, but excludes
any campaign reward plans. If you experience a “Plan limit reached” error,
please remove your other unused plans. We strongly encourage you to regularly
remove failed plans or unused plans to avoid hitting the limit.

8. How to edit, pause or stop my Auto-Invest plans?

You can edit a plan, for example, change the amount or frequency of the
investment using the following:

1\. On the Auto-Invest Home page, use the editing options available under each
plan.

2\. On the Earn Wallet Page, click [Edit] to edit your plan.

You can pause or stop your Auto-Invest plans using one of the following
options:

1\. On the Auto-Invest Homepage, you can toggle the button next to [On/Off] to
pause or resume a plan. To stop a plan permanently, use the editing options
available under each plan.

2\. On the Earn Wallet Page, you can also repeat the steps above to pause or
stop your Auto-Invest plans.

9. What are the differences between Auto-Invest & Recurring Buy?

Auto-Invest is similar to Recurring Buy. They both allow you to automate
crypto purchases regularly. However, Auto-Invest will automatically deposit
your purchased crypto like [Bitcoin](/price/bitcoin) and
[Ethereum](/price/ethereum) into your Simple Earn Flexible Products account,
so you can grow your crypto holdings easily. Apart from that, Auto-Invest
supports buying crypto with stablecoins, fiat currencies or cryptos that are
allowed for subscription, while Recurring Buy supports fiat with Credit/Debit
Card payments.

Note: In some jurisdictions and circumstances, the digital assets purchased on
Auto-Invest will be transferred to your Spot Wallet and will not earn Simple
Earn Flexible rewards, please see Where are my Auto-Invest assets?

10. At what price will the transactions of my Auto-Invest plans be executed?

Auto-Invest prices are different to market prices on Binance Spot, Convert,
and Liquidity pools. Auto-invest is a premium service with features including
automatic purchases, a fully curated Portfolio service, a fully self-managed
Index-Linked Plan service and advanced management of plans. As a result, Auto-
Invest prices may not be the same as Binance Spot Market, Convert &amp;
Liquidity Pool Prices. You should consider whether this is important to you
before subscribing. All Auto-Invest transactions are conducted in accordance
with the Auto-Invest [Terms of Use](/terms-autoinvest).

The price of the cryptos purchased will be recorded under [Auto-Invest
History] page. Disclaimer: Binance has no obligation to ensure that you have
purchased Digital Assets using the best available exchange rate.

11. What fee will I be charged for Auto-Invest subscriptions?

There will be a fee charged for all purchases on Auto-Invest. The percentage
&amp; amount of fees charged per transaction will be displayed in the Auto-
Invest purchase history under [History] - [Subscription].

The amount of cryptocurrencies purchased will be determined by the price quote
used in our Auto-Invest transaction system. For more information, please see
At what price will the transactions of my Auto-Invest plans be executed?

For Index-Linked Plan Rebalancing Fees: There is an additional rebalancing
fee, please see Will I be charged a rebalancing fee?

Disclaimer: Binance may change these fees from time to time, and will
communicate that changes by updating the purchase summary and history under
[History] \- [Subscription].

12. What is the Auto-Invest Index-Linked Plan?

The Auto-Invest Index-Linked Plan allows you to automate the purchase of
cryptocurrencies that make up the Binance CoinMarketCap (CMC) Top 10 Equal-
Weighted Index. You can buy the tokens in the same proportion as the Index on
a periodic basis, and the monthly portfolio rebalancing offers you a
convenient way to continue to hold cryptocurrency in the same proportion as
the Index as it changes over time.

For more information, please see our FAQ on [What Is Auto-Invest Index-Linked
Plan and How to Use It?](/support/faq/what-is-auto-invest-index-linked-plan-
and-how-to-use-it-7c3d334a57f74268b0df67bbeb1df41c)

13. What is in the Index-Linked Plan and the filtering criteria?

The cryptocurrencies that make up the index are dependent on the filtering
criteria of the index constituents of the Binance CoinMarketCap (CMC) Top 10
Equal-Weighted Index:

\- Have been listed on the Binance Exchange Platform and CoinMarketCap for at
least 30 days;

\- Are not wrapped, pegged to another digital asset, non-digital (Fiat)
currencies, group of those currencies, or physical assets;

\- Are not algorithmic stablecoins;

\- Does not include CoinMarketCap Top Memes Tokens by Market Capitalization;

14. How to create an Auto-Invest Index-Linked Plan?

1\. Go to [Multi Assets] \- [Index-Linked]. Tap [Subscribe] to start.

2\. You will see the Top 10 Equal-Weighted Index stats and constituents.

3\. Insert subscription [Amount] either in stablecoins, fiat currencies or
cryptos that are allowed for subscriptions.

4\. Select a Payment Order. You can also choose to enable the [Simple Earn
Wallet] option. Once enabled, if your Spot Wallet balance is insufficient, the
system will automatically redeem the assets from your balance in Simple Earn
Flexible Products to complete the purchase.

5\. Then, select the [Recurring Cycle] and a specific [Time] for the purchase.
You can Toggle [One-Time] to enable one-time purchase!

6\. Read the notes and check the box next to each to confirm. Tap [Confirm] to
create the plan.

7\. Your Auto-Invest Index-Linked Plan has now been created and will be
processed based on your recurring cycle settings!

15. How to manage my Auto-Invest Index-Linked Plan?

Please note that you cannot view, edit, redeem, or remove a plan during the
rebalancing period.

Go to [My Auto-Invest Plan] \- [My Index-Linked] to manage your ongoing plans
- both Recurring and One-Time purchases. To manage a plan, use the editing
options available under each plan.

Any Recurring purchases of the Auto-Invest Index-Linked Plans scheduled during
the rebalancing period will be skipped. The plan will resume normal after the
rebalancing is completed. New One-Time purchases of the Auto-Invest Index-
Linked Plans are not allowed during rebalancing, but your existing and already
processed One-Time purchases will go through monthly rebalancing.

Redeem Assets

To redeem your purchased assets, go to the [Earn Wallet] and click [Redeem].
Enter the redemption percentage and tap [Confirm]. Your redeemed assets will
be distributed to your Spot Wallet within a few minutes.

Remove the Plan

To remove the plan, go to the Auto-Invest Home page and do either 1 of the
following:

1\. Click on the [Bin] icon next to the desired plan and click [Remove].

2\. Click on the [Next Auto-Invest Date] Schedule and click [Remove Plan].

16. How do I redeem the assets purchased through the Index-Linked Plan?

You can redeem a portion or the total amount of the purchased assets from your
Recurring or One-Time Index-Linked Plan anytime, except when the plan is being
rebalanced.

Please note that you need to redeem all tokens on the plan with an equal
percentage. For example, you can redeem 20% of the 10 tokens you purchased
from the plan, but you cannot redeem 20% of a single token only.

17. How to view my Auto-Invest Index-Linked Plan history?

To view your plan records, click [Go to History] on the Auto-Invest Homepage.
Here you can view your subscription, redemption, and rebalancing records.

You may use the filters to search for a specific plan's record.

18. When will my index-linked plan transactions be processed?

For Recurring purchases: All Recurring index-linked plan transactions are
submitted for processing at the scheduled time and the transactions will be
successfully processed in a timely manner depending on dynamic factors such as
number of transactions to be processed.

For One-Time purchase: All One-Time index-linked plan transactions are real-
time transactions.

Disclaimer: Binance will make reasonable efforts to ensure that transactions
on the Platform are processed in a timely manner, however sometimes factors
outside of our control may slow down processing times. See our [terms and
conditions](/terms-autoinvest) for more details.

19. What is rebalancing and when does it occur?

All Index-Linked Plans assets (Recurring or One-Time) retained within the
Auto-Invest account will experience a monthly rebalancing.

As the cryptocurrency market is ever-changing, the value of each
cryptocurrency may change over time. Through regular rebalancing, you can
automatically buy and sell portions of your cryptocurrency holdings to bring
each asset's weight to an allocation that matches the Index.

On the fourth Monday of every month at UTC 00:00, the data provided by the
index’s data provider, at that time, will be used for the purposes of
Rebalancing. On the Friday of the same week, the rebalancing of Auto-Invest
Index-Linked Plan will start at any time within the day and will finish after
approximately 3-6 hours. You cannot view, edit, redeem, or remove the plan
during the rebalancing period. Once completed, you will be able to view the
revised plan details from [My Auto-Invest Plan] \- [My Index-Linked].

Please note that after rebalancing, the list of assets may differ compared to
before rebalancing.

Any Auto-Invest Index-Linked Plan transactions scheduled during the
rebalancing period will be skipped. The plan will resume as normal after the
rebalancing is completed. Any plans redeemed before the monthly rebalancing
will not be rebalanced.

20. How do I stop rebalancing?

You cannot stop rebalancing. As long as you have the available assets in a
Recurring or One-Time Index-Linked plan, the portfolio will rebalance
regularly.

Please note that even if you pause the plan, the rebalancing will still happen
every month.

21. Will I be charged a rebalancing fee?

You will be charged a rebalancing fee when your Index-Linked Plan rebalances
to match, as near as possible, the composition of a Binance Index (e.g., the
[Top 10 Equal-Weighted Index](/ew-index)).

Disclaimer: Binance may change these fees from time to time, and will
communicate that changes by updating the rebalancing summary and history under
[History] - [Rebalancing].
