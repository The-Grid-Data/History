Through the WABI protocol, consumers can make better, informed choices about the products and goods they use.\u003cbr/\u003eIn addition, the Wabi platform rewards consumers with WABI points that can be redeemed on the marketplace. Consumers can redeem their tokens, browse  thousands of listings and score discounts on items.\u003cbr/\u003eBrands can leverage the Wabi ecosystem to reach wider audiences, access consumer behavior data and other information, in order to make more informed marketing decisions.The FMCG industry can leverage these utilities and significantly cut down the duration of the idea-to-market feedback loop to a matter of days.","widget-common-coin-use-body-xlm":"Stellar (XLM) is relatively easy to use. Stellar was built for trading currencies in a transparent way. Here's an explanation of XLM's borderless and innovative reach: Users can simply create a graphical representation of a fiat currency like the US Dollar. This graphical representation is called a dollar token, and the dollar token maintains a 1:1 relationship with the fiat currency it represents.\u003cbr/\u003eBecause a system of electronic credits has been created for the dollar, the underlying dollar never needs to leave the account, which means no bank needs to approve loans for the token. At the same time, because the digital tokens are accessible to any user who has an internet connection, the tokens–unlike their fiat equivalents–are borderless.","widget-common-coin-use-body-xrm":"Monero has several unique features not commonly offered on other cryptocurrencies. The majority of Monero’s use-cases are centered around privacy. Monero makes it impossible to trace transactions back to the original transacting parties.","widget-common-coin-use-body-xrp":"At its core, XRP Ledger is an open-source, permissionless and distributed ledger that is operated by a network of peer-to-peer servers. The network seeks to achieve improved currency utility over legacy payment channels, as XRP can be used by a wide range of third parties that seek to augment their value through decentralized means.\u003cbr/\u003eThe XRP Ledger operates on the basis of validator nodes that collect the set of all candidate transactions and reach consensus on transactions that occurred before the cut-off time for any given ledger. Once the set of transactions is agreed upon, they are executed in a deterministic order, subject to the objective rules of the network, as imposed by every server independently. The ledger reaches consensus on all outstanding transactions every 3-5 seconds.","widget-common-coin-use-body-zec":"ZEC has been fondly called the “HTTPS of blockchains”, as it is designed to make transactions seamless and intuitive. In addition to buying and selling ZEC, the cryptocurrency can be used to pay for goods and services, as some stores and online merchants accept ZEC payments.\u003cbr/\u003eAt its core, ZEC attempts to maintain user privacy by being anonymous rather than pseudonymous. This means the identities and addresses of senders and receivers are visible.

It is designed to allow miners of Scrypt-based cryptocurrencies to simultaneously mine VIA tokens. Popular examples of scrypt-based cryptocurrencies include Litecoin and Dogecoin. The VIA token is compatible with Lightning Network, a second layer technology used to improve scalability.\u003cbr/\u003eOriginally, scrypt-based cryptocurrencies could not be mined by ASIC hardware. This gave Viacoin and similar tokens key advantages over Bitcoin, which is ASIC-reliant. However, the newer versions of ASIC products can be used to mine Litecoin, Viacoin and other cryptocurrencies.","widget-common-coin-what-is-body-wabi":"The Wabi ecosystem is designed to improve the relationship between brands and consumers, so consumers can gain incentives in exchange for brands holding on to their user data.\u003cbr/\u003eFurthermore, consumers can utilize the ecosystem to make informed choices for their brands, while brands can also take advantage of WABI to make more informed marketing decisions.

Chains running on Proof-of-Work that do not have fast finality can still be included in the IBC with the help of “Peg Zones” that impose a “finality threshold” for some number of blocks, by assuming transactions are effectively final.\u003cbr/\u003eThe Cosmos network’s IBC works by bonding an amount of ATOM, then relaying a proof of the ATOM bonding to a second chain, and then validation of said proof, before a corresponding amount is released on the second chain. This makes it easier to issue and create tokens representing assets on other chains.","widget-common-coin-work-body-one":"The Harmony ecosystem uses an Effective Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. Having hundreds of validators reduces stake centralization by making it more difficult for a small group of validators to suddenly take over the network. Apart from voting rights, this Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus mechanism also ensures that staking rewards are distributed fairly, giving everyone a chance to participate.\u003cbr/\u003eHarmony uses sharding to achieve true scalability in storage, network and transaction processing. New blocks are produced within two seconds and the shards include participants from more than 100 countries. Even the network validators aren't all in one shard—instead, they are scattered across all 100.","widget-common-coin-work-body-rvn":"RVN uses an advanced model inspired by Bitcoin's UTXO model. Ravencoin tokens aren't mined like Bitcoin, nor does Ravencoin employ the SHA-256 hashing algorithm used by Bitcoin miners. Therefore, ASIC mining, the hallmark of Bitcoin mining, is not allowed on the Ravencoin network.\u003cbr/\u003eThe X16R algorithm used by Ravencoin levels the playing field, allowing people to mine tokens without using expensive mining hardware. Consequently, mining rewards for Ravencoin start at 5,000 RVN compared to Bitcoin at 50 BTC. The algorithm also makes Ravencoin's block time significantly faster than Bitcoin's.\u003cbr/\u003eThe maximum supply of Ravencoin is 21 billion. Users on the network can create unique asset tokens by burning RVN and setting the parameters for issuance. There are reward tokens, non-asset tokens and unique tokens, with each serving a different purpose.","widget-common-coin-work-body-via":"Viacoin utilizes scrypt merged mining, which levels the figurative playing field for miners. Viacoin miners can use another network as the parent chain for mining the VIA token. They piggyback on the computing power of Litecoin to simultaneously mine VIA. This method increases network security thanks to the hash power of the parent chain, Litecoin.\u003cbr/\u003eMiners will be rewarded both Litecoin and Viacoin, while expending the same energy they would use for Litecoin.

XMR uses a combination of ring signatures, stealth addresses, RingCT, Tor/I2P and Dandelion++ to enhance security and privacy.\u003cbr/\u003eRing signatures are digital signatures that are anonymous from one member of a group. Monero uses the sender's private keys and merges them with the public keys to generate a ring signature. Stealth addresses are one-time addresses that are generated for each transaction on behalf of the user, thereby concealing the identity of both parties. RingCT was introduced in 2017 as an additional process that further conceals transaction amounts.","widget-common-coin-work-body-xrp":"The ledger features a decentralized exchange that allows the trading of IOUs and XRP.
