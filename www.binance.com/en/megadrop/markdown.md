What is Binance Megadrop?

+

Binance Megadrop is a new token launch platform that seamlessly integrates
Binance Simple Earn and the Binance Web3 Wallet, reinventing the airdrop
experience. Megadrop grants users early access to select Web3 projects before
they are listed on Binance.

2

How do I lock BNB to earn points?

+

You can visit the BNB Simple Earn Locked Products page and follow the
instructions to subscribe your BNB to Locked Products. Your Locked BNB Score
will be determined by the quantity of BNB subscribed and the length of the
subscription period. Longer subscriptions yield higher scores, and
consequently, higher rewards. For more details, please visit the Megadrop page
on the Binance app and refer to the announcement.

How do I complete Web3 quests to boost my score?

+

Visit the Megadrop page and you will find the quest introduction in the
project detail page. You can check the tutorials and start the web3 quests
from there.

What is Binance Web3 Wallet?

+

Binance Web3 Wallet is a self-custody crypto wallet within the Binance app,
designed to empower users in the realm of decentralized finance (DeFi).
Serving as a digital gateway to blockchain-based applications (dApps), it
offers users a secure and streamlined method to manage their cryptocurrencies,
execute token swaps across multiple chains, earn yields, and interact with a
variety of blockchain platforms.
