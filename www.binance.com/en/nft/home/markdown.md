Binance NFT Marketplace Terms and Conditions

A. Binance NFT Marketplace

By participating in Binance NFT Marketplace and any of its associated services
you acknowledge that you have read, understood and accepted all of the terms
and conditions herein (the “NFT Marketplace Terms”), and you acknowledge and
agree that you will be bound by and will comply with these NFT Marketplace
Terms. If you do not understand and accept these NFT Marketplace Terms in
their entirety, you should not participate.

B. Overview of Binance NFT Marketplace

1\. The Binance NFT Marketplace provides you with the opportunity to create
(mint), sell, purchase, bid on, collect, trade, showcase and otherwise
transact digital blockchain collectibles, which may be represented as a non-
fungible token (“NFT”) linked with certain digital media and art (“NFT
Media"). We facilitate transactions between a buyer and seller of an NFT, but
we are not a party to any agreement between buyer and seller of an NFT on the
Binance NFT Marketplace. We collect revenue on the Binance NFT Marketplace via
transaction fees and other applicable fees which we display when you interact
with the Binance NFT Marketplace. For the avoidance of doubt, NFTs transacted
on the Binance NFT Marketplace are considered “Digital Assets” as defined in
the Terms. Binance reserves the right to (but is not required or obligated to
be) take any action in relation to any disputes arising from purchases via the
Binance NFT Marketplace, including in connection with any auctions or other
purchase methods.

C. NFT Sellers

2\. By minting, providing, or selling an NFT through the Binance NFT
Marketplace, you hereby represent and warrant that you own all legal right,
title, and interest in all Intellectual Property Rights to the NFT Media
linked or associated with such NFT, or you are legally authorised by the
Intellectual Property Right owner to mint, provide or sell the NFT on the
Binance NFT Marketplace. Except for NFTs minted on the Binance NFT
Marketplace, in order to list any NFT for sale on the Binance NFT Marketplace,
you must first deposit the NFT for sale for custody with Binance until such
time as the NFT is sold or you decide to remove the NFT from the Binance NFT
Marketplace. For clarity, Binance (and any associated entity) has no
obligation or liability to you for keeping, storing, or helping you recover
any NFT Media associated with your NFTs.

D. NFT Buyers

3\. When you purchase an NFT, you own the NFT that is associated with certain
NFT Media, but you do not own any Intellectual Property Rights in such NFT
Media except for the license grants expressly set forth herein. In certain
cases, we may help to evaluate or provide you with information about a seller
of an NFT. However, such information is provided for informational purposes
only. You bear full responsibility for verifying the authenticity, legitimacy,
and identity of any NFT you purchase on the Binance NFT Marketplace. We make
no representations, guarantees, or promises about the identity, legitimacy,
legality, decency, quality, or authenticity of any NFT on the Binance NFT
Marketplace. Notwithstanding any sale clearing period that may be implemented
for the sale of any NFTs, you acknowledge that Binance is not required or
obligated to adjudicate or decide on any disputes in connection with any NFTs
sold on the Binance NFT Marketplace.

E. Licence to your content

4\. In connection with your use of the Binance NFT Marketplace, you may be
able to post, upload, or submit content to be made available through the
Binance NFT Marketplace, including NFT Media that is tied to NFTs you wish to
sell on the Binance NFT Marketplace as a seller, and any other content
associated with your NFTs (“Your Content'). You retain all rights to Your
Content you post, upload, submit, or otherwise make available through the
Binance NFT Marketplace, except for rights expressly granted herein. In order
to operate the Binance NFT Marketplace, we must obtain from you certain
license rights in Your Content so that actions we take in operating the
Binance NFT Marketplace are not considered legal violations. Accordingly, by
using the Binance NFT Marketplace and uploading Your Content or otherwise made
Your Content available, you grant us a license to access, use, host, cache,
store, copy, reproduce, transmit, display, publish, distribute, adapt, and
modify (for technical purposes, e.g., making sure content is viewable on
smartphones as well as computers and other devices) Your Content in any and
all media or distribution methods (now know or later developed) but solely as
required to be able to operate and provide services of the Binance NFT
Marketplace. You agree that this license includes the right for us to provide,
promote, and improve the Binance NFT Marketplace and to make Your Content
available to other companies, organisations, or individuals for the
distribution, promotion, or publication of Your Content on other media and
services. You agree that these rights and licenses are royalty free,
transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide, and irrevocable (for so long as Your
Content is stored with us), and include a right for us to make Your Content
available to, and pass these rights along to, others with whom we have
contractual relationships related to the provision of the Binance NFT
Marketplace, and solely for purpose of providing the Binance NFT Marketplace,
and to otherwise permit access to disclose Your Content to third parties if we
determine such access is necessary to comply with our legal obligations.

5\. As part of the foregoing license grant, you agree that the other users of
the Binance NFT Marketplace shall have the right to comment on and/or tag Your
Content and/or to use, publish, display, modify or include a copy of Your
Content as part of their own use of the Binance NFT Marketplace; except that
the foregoing shall not apply to any of Your Content that you post privately
for non-public display on the Binance NFT Marketplace. By posting or
submitting Your Content to the Binance NFT Marketplace, you represent and
warrant that you have, or have obtained, all rights, licenses, consents,
permissions, power and/or authority necessary to grant the rights granted
herein for Your Content. You agree that Your Content will not contain material
subject to copyright or other proprietary rights, unless you have the
necessary permission or are otherwise legally entitled to post the material
and grant us the license described above.

6\. If you sell an NFT through the Binance NFT Marketplace, you grant to the
buyer of the NFT a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free
license to use, copy, and display the NFT Media for such purchased NFT, solely
for the following purposes: (a) for the buyer's own personal use; (b) as part
of a marketplace that permits the purchase and sale of such NFTs, provided
that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each NFT's owner's rights to
display the NFT Media for their NFTs to ensure that only the actual owner can
display the NFT Media; or (c) as part of a third-party website or application
that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of your NFT,
provided that the website/application cryptographically verifies each NFT's
owner's rights to display the NFT Media for their NFTs to ensure that only the
actual owner can display the NFT Media, and provided that the NFT Media is no
longer visible once the owner of the NFTs leaves the website/application (the
“NFT Purchase License”).

7\. If you are a buyer of NFTs, then you acknowledge and agree that the NFT
Purchase License set forth above only lasts as long as you are the valid owner
and holder of the NFT associated with the licensed NFT Media. If you sell or
transfer the NFT to another person, this NFT Purchase License will transfer to
such other owner or holder of the NFT, and you will no longer have the
benefits of such NFT Purchase License. Unless otherwise specified by the
seller of an NFT in writing, your purchase of an NFT does not give you the
right to publicly display, perform, distribute, sell or otherwise reproduce
the NFT or its related NFT Media for any commercial purpose.

8\. If you sell an NFT, you agree that you will not have any claims against
Binance for any breach of these NFT Terms by a purchaser, including if they
make commercial use of the related NFT Media in breach of these NFT Terms.

9\. We have the right to remove or refuse to post any of Your Content,
including NFTs, (a) for any or no reason in our sole discretion; and (b) take
any action with respect to Your Content that we deem necessary or appropriate
in our sole discretion, including if we believe that Your Content violates
these NFT Terms or the Terms, infringes any Intellectual Property Right of any
person or entity, threatens the personal safety of users of the Binance NFT
Marketplace or the public, or could create liability for Binance or other
users.

F. Specific Terms for the Premium Platform and Creators

10\. As part of the Binance NFT Marketplace, Binance offers a premium platform
(the “Premium Platform') which only allows creators that are invited or
otherwise approved by Binance (“Invited Creators") to mint and sell NFTs
(“Creator NFTs”). The Invited Creator's original NFT Media being the
“Creator's NFT Media”. Binance may enter into an addendum with any Invited
Creator (a “Creator Addendum”) setting forth terms for using the Premium
Platform as an Invited Creator. If there is a conflict between a Creator
Addendum and these NFT Terms, the provisions of the Creator Addendum shall
take precedence for such Invited Creator.

11\. The Invited Creator hereby grants to Binance a perpetual, irrevocable,
and exclusive right and license to use, reproduce, and display the Creator's
NFT Media in connection with the promotion of the Creator's NFT Media, the
Creator's NFTs and the Binance NFT Marketplace. For clarity, unless otherwise
specified in a Creator Addendum, the exclusive license granted above means
that Invited Creator cannot itself, or grant to any other party any right to,
use, reproduce, display the Creator's NFT Media in connection with non-
fungible tokens or any other collectibles, platforms or services.

12\. In order for Binance to exercise its rights to the Creator's NFT Media,
Invited Creator will provide Binance with high-resolution images and NFT Media
as reasonably requested by Binance. Binance shall have the sole control over
the promotion and marketing of the Creator's NFTs, including the sole
discretion to select certain Creator's NFTs or Invited Creators to participate
in events hosted by Binance. As reasonably requested by Binance, Invited
Creator will support Binance in the promotion or marketing of the Creator's
NFTs through participation in the marketing activities as agreed upon by the
parties in a Creator Addendum. In connection with the promotion of the
Creator's NFTs, the Invited Creator hereby grants Binance a right to use the
name, image, photo, biography, signature, and likeness of the Invited Creator
solely in connection with the marketing and promotion of the Creator's NFTs.

13\. Invited Creator will not engage in any promotion or marketing of Binance,
the Binance NFT Marketplace, or any Creator's NFTs in a manner that is
misleading or deceptive or not in compliance with applicable law. Invited
Creator must disclose any material connection between Invited Creator and
Binance in any such promotion in a clear and conspicuous manner, including in
close proximity to any such marketing statements. Invited Creator will not
promote or market the Creator's NFTs in a manner intended to give buyers the
impression that such NFTs are investment products or that they can expect
capital appreciation or derive profits from the purchase of such NFTs, or
indicate that such NFTs may be characterised as securities or any other form
of regulated investment product in any applicable jurisdiction.

14\. If requested by Binance, Invited Creator will reasonably cooperate with
Binance to validate the authenticity of the Creator's NFTs and the Creator’s
NFT Media.

15\. Invited Creator acknowledges and agrees that Binance will charge a
platform fee which is 10% (or other percentage as provided in a Creator
Addendum) of the purchase price for any sale of the Creator's NFTs on the
Premium Platform.

16\. For the avoidance of doubt, any use of or interaction with the Premium
Platform by any User (including an Invited Creator) is governed by terms in
this Section E and the rest of these NFT Terms not in direct contradiction
with the terms in this Section E.

G. Specific Terms for the Standard Platform and Initial Sale

17\. As part of the NFT Marketplace, Binance offers a standard platform (the
"Standard Platform”) which allows any registered users to create NFT
collections (subject to paying an associated smart contract deployment fee)
and mint and sell NFTs (the “Standard NFTs") associated with the user's NFT
Media. Creators of Standard NFTs can also set their own royalty fee for their
NFT collections.

18\. For an initial sale of a Standard NFT (i.e., the first instance a newly
minted Standard NFT is sold by the creator to a buyer), the transaction
proceeds from the sale of the Standard NFT (the “Transaction Proceeds”) shall
be frozen in the seller's account for a pre-specified period of time (the
"Initial Sale Clearing Period'') after which the Transaction Proceeds will be
released to the seller.

19\. Binance may extend the Initial Sale Clearing Period for a further period
of time (the “Extended Clearing Period”) provided that:

a. within the Initial Sale Clearing Period, a bona fide complaint is raised by
the buyer or a third party for claims that relate to intellectual property
infringement, the identity, legitimacy, authenticity, and/or validity of legal
title of the Standard NFT, violation of the Binance Terms, these NFT Terms
and/or violation of the terms of the NFT sale as agreed between the seller and
the buyer. For any claim raised by the buyer, the buyer shall furnish proof
that the Standard NFT at issue remains in their account and agrees to have the
NFT frozen pending resolution of the dispute. The buyer or the third party
submitting a complaint shall agree that Binance may supply a copy of this
complaint to the seller, including the buyer/third party's identity and
contact details.

b. Binance suspects the Standard NFT, the Standard NFT transaction, the
seller's activity in relation to the Standard NFT and/or the Transaction
Proceeds to be in violation of the applicable terms of sale (including the
Binance Terms and these NFT Terms) or any applicable laws and regulations.

20\. After the Extended Clearing Period, Binance may only continue to freeze
the Transaction Proceeds if legal proceedings or investigations by the
authorities have been commenced against the seller (and where such legal
proceedings or investigations require the Transaction Proceeds to be frozen),
or in such other circumstances that Binance deems appropriate in its sole
discretion. For the avoidance of doubt, Binance reserves the right to freeze
and take such other action in respect of the Transaction Proceeds (being
Digital Assets or funds in a Binance User's Account) in accordance with the
Binance Terms, regardless of whether the situation is expressly provided for
under this Section F. In such circumstances, Binance has the discretion to
extend the freeze for any further duration pending the resolution of the
dispute. If receive proof that such a formal legal action or complaint has
been filed within the Extend Clearing Period, Binance may be entitled to
release the Transaction Proceeds to the seller.

21\. If the complainant and the seller are able to resolve the dispute at any
stage, Binance will require written confirmation of the resolution of the
dispute from all parties before it may proceed to release the Transaction
Proceeds to the seller.

22\. In no circumstances shall Binance bear any liability or responsibility
for any act or omission done in relation to the freezing (or omission to
freeze) of the Transaction Proceeds, and there shall be no freezing as part of
any secondary sale of Standard NFTs.

23\. In addition, by minting a Standard NFT, you acknowledge and agree that
you have read and accept the “NFT Minting Rules”, which includes examples of
inappropriate content and our right at our sole discretion to, among other
things, delist or otherwise remove your NFT collection(s) or Standard NFTs
from the Binance NFT Marketplace.

24\. For the avoidance of doubt, any use of or interaction with the Standard
Platform by any user is governed by terms in this Section F and the rest of
these NFT Terms not in direct contradiction with the terms in this Section G.

H. Intellectual Property Policy

25\. You can only upload/generate content to Binance NFT Marketplace, via
Bixel or otherwise that does not violate someone else’s intellectual property
rights.

Binance takes intellectual property seriously and does not condone the use of
intellectual property in any manner that is in violation of applicable laws.
Binance may, but is not obligated to, monitor the NFTs, NFT Media, content
generated by your use of Bixel, and Your Content uploaded to the Binance NFT
Marketplace for any infringement of a third party's Intellectual Property
Rights. However, Binance cannot undertake to review all such content before it
is posted on the Service, and cannot ensure prompt removal of objectionable
content after it has been posted. Accordingly, Binance assumes no liability
for any action regarding transmissions, communications, or content provided by
any user or third party. Binance will take down content/NFTs in response to
applicable legal takedown notices and/or other intellectual property
infringement claims and will terminate a seller's access if the seller is
deemed to be a repeat infringer. Binance does not make determinations as to
the legal merit of intellectual property claims. If you are an intellectual
property rights owner or the authorised representative of an intellectual
property owner, and believe that any content appearing on the services have
been copied in a way that constitutes intellectual property infringement, you
may report and submit an intellectual property take-down request
(“Intellectual Property Take-Down Request”) to us, by providing the following
information in writing:

a. the basis of your Intellectual Property Take-Down Request, identification
and evidence of the intellectual property (e.g. your copyrighted work,
trademark registration certificate/details) that is claimed to be infringed;

b. identification of the allegedly infringing material that is requested to be
removed, including a description of where it is located on the Binance NFT
Marketplace;

c. an authorisation letter (if you are not the intellectual property owner but
authorised to act on behalf of the same) and/or your complete contact
information for us to contact you (full name, address, telephone number, and
e-mail address). Only the intellectual property rights owner or their
authorised representative may submit an Intellectual Property Take-Down
Request. By submitting Intellectual Property Take-Down Request, you agree that
we may provide the rights owner’s/authorised representative’s contact
information to the party whose content you are reporting;

d. a statement that you have a good faith belief that the identified,
allegedly infringing use is not authorised by the intellectual property rights
owner(s), its agent, or the law;

e. a statement that the information above is accurate, and under penalty of
perjury, that you are the intellectual property right owner or the authorised
person to act on behalf of the intellectual property rights owner; and

f. the physical or electronic signature of a person authorised to act on
behalf of the owner of the intellectual property right that is allegedly
infringed.

26\. Intellectual Property Take-Down Requests should be sent by e-mail to
legal@binance.com. It is our policy, in appropriate circumstances and at our
discretion, to ask for more information, remove the reported content, disable
or terminate the accounts of users who repeatedly infringe the intellectual
property rights of others.

27\. Any affected user of an Intellectual Property Takedown Request described
above may supply a counter-notification if the content was removed because of
a mistake or misidentification. When we receive a counter notification, we may
at our discretion, forward a copy to the party that reported and submitted the
Intellectual Property Takedown Request; forward the affected user with details
for the Intellectual Property Takedown Request and contact information of the
party that submitted the report; encourage parties to resolve the dispute
directly; reinstate the content in question . To file a counter-notification
with us, you must provide a written communication ( by email) that sets forth:

a. your contact information (full name, address, telephone number, e-mail
address, and physical or electronic signature). By submitting a counter-
notification, you agree that we may provide your contact information to the
party that submitted the Intellectual Property Takedown Request;

b. identification of the content that has been removed or to which access has
been disabled and the location at which the content appeared before it was
removed or access to it was disabled; and

c. a statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that
the content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or
misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.

I. Restrictions on Marketing and Promotional Activities and Logo Use

28\. Any marketing and promotional activities, whether in digital, print, or
any other form, that you may conduct in connection with your use of the
Binance NFT Marketplace are subject to our review and prior written approval.
We will only allow marketing and promotional activities to be referred to

limited to details of the relevant NFT projects, all planned media channels or
distributions, relationships between different counterparties, etc.

29\. No mention of token-related topics or any implication relating to token

parties, including intellectual property rights; (c) breach any Applicable
Laws and regulations; (d) breach any of our guidelines or instructions that
may be made available to you; and (e) bring into disrepute or damage the

30\. You must not use Binance's name, logo, trade names, and any other marks
(“Binance Marks”) without our prior written approval. Subject to further
guidelines that may be made available to you, we may permit you to use the

promoting your NFTs on the Binance NFT Marketplace. Terms of such guidelines
made available to you shall be incorporated into these terms by express
reference herein.

31\. You agree to indemnify us against all liabilities, costs, expenses,
damages and losses (including but not limited to any direct, indirect or
consequential losses, loss of profit, loss of reputation, loss of goodwill and
all interest, penalties and legal costs (calculated on a full indemnity
basis), and all other professional costs and expenses) suffered or incurred by
us arising out of or in connection with any such marketing and promotional
activities that you conduct in connection with your use of the Binance NFT
Marketplace.

J. Verification and Payment

32\. When you make purchases through the Binance NFT Marketplace, including,
without limitation, any purchase for NFTs, you must provide and maintain valid

Terms) with us. You represent and warrant that you are authorised to use the
payment method you use via the Binance NFT Marketplace to make any purchase.
You authorise us to charge your payment method for the total amount of your
purchase price. Your order may be suspended or cancelled for any reason,

33\. We have no liability to you or any third party for any claims or damages
that may arise as a result of any payments or transactions that you engage in

34\. You will be solely responsible to pay any and all sales, use, value-added
and other taxes, duties, and assessments (except taxes on our net income) now
or hereafter claimed or imposed by any governmental authority associated with
your use of the Binance NFT Marketplace or NFTs, except for income taxes
levied on us as a result of such purchases of NFTs.

K. Other risks

35\. Any purchase or sale you make, accept or facilitate outside of the
Binance NFT Marketplace of an NFT will be entirely at your risk. You
acknowledge that you have obtained sufficient information to make an informed
decision to purchase an NFT, including carefully reviewing the code of the
smart contract and the NFT and fully understand and accept the functions of
the same. Notwithstanding any access provided on the Binance NFT Marketplace,
we do not control or endorse purchases or sales of NFTs outside of the Binance
NFT Marketplace. We expressly deny and disclaim any liability to you and deny
any obligation to indemnify you or hold you harmless for any losses you may
incur by transacting, or facilitating transactions, in NFTs outside of the
Binance NFT Marketplace.

36\. Certain parts of the Binance NFT Marketplace may display, include or make
available content, data, information, applications, or materials from third
parties (“Third Party Materials”). By using the Binance NFT Marketplace, you
acknowledge and agree that Binance is not responsible for examining or
evaluating the content, accuracy, completeness, availability, timeliness,
validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality, or any other
aspect of such Third Party Materials. We do not warrant or endorse and do not

DEMANDS, AND DAMAGES OF EVERY KIND AND NATURE, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, ARISING OUT
OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH SUCH DISPUTES. IN ENTERING INTO THIS RELEASE
YOU EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY PROTECTIONS (WHETHER STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE) THAT
WOULD OTHERWISE LIMIT THE COVERAGE OF THIS RELEASE TO INCLUDE THOSE CLAIMS
WHICH YOU MAY KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN YOUR FAVOUR AT THE TIME OF AGREEING
TO THIS RELEASE.

L. NFT Aggregation Service

38\. We provide an aggregation service which helps you explore and purchase
NFTs created by third-parties and interact with third party exchanges’ and
external parties’ listings of NFTs (“Third Party Listings” on “Third Party
Platforms”). The NFT Terms set out herein shall apply to any purchases you
make of any such Third Party Listings, and, as set out in Section J, you are
solely responsible, at your own risk, for your purchases in respect of Third
Party Listings. We do not make any representations or warranties about any
Third Party Listings available via the NFT Marketplace, including any third
party content associated with NFTs displayed on the NFT Marketplace and you
bear responsibility for verifying the legitimacy, authenticity, and legality
of NFTs that you purchase from all third party vendors. Third Party Listings
are being provided as a convenience and for user benefit only; they do not
constitute an endorsement or an approval by Binance of any of the Third Party
Listings, the third party exchanges or their broader products, the services or
opinions of the third party exchanges, or the quality or reputability of the
third party organisation or individuals involved in their operation. Binance
bears no responsibility for the accuracy, legality or content of the third
party exchange or for that of subsequent links on that third party exchange.
Contact the external party for answers to questions regarding its content. For
the avoidance of doubt, Binance cannot guarantee that any NFTs visible on the
NFT Marketplace will always remain visible and/or available to be bought,
sold, or transferred.

39\. Upon initiating a transaction for a Third Party Listing you authorize us
to initiate the payment to the third party and transfer the NFT to your
account. We cannot guarantee that the transaction will settle and in the event
of the transaction not completing you agree that you will bear the costs of
the transaction and any resulting loss incurred by failure to complete the
transaction. You agree that all rewards, tokens, points, gifts, or other user
prizes usually associated with your purchase of any Third Party Listing on the
originating third party exchange (“Third Party Rewards”), shall not be made
available or otherwise transferred to you in the event of you purchasing a
Third Party Listing on the Binance NFT Market. You are purchasing the Third
Party Listing from Binance as is, with no Third Party Rewards (even if these
are advertised on the third party exchange or anywhere else). We will let you
know when you are purchasing a Third Party Listing.

M. Open Listings

40\. The Binance NFT Marketplace has a feature that allows you to easily list
your NFT and its NFT Media on Third Party Platforms (an “Open List”). By using
Open List you consent to your NFT being posted to Third Party Platforms and
being made available for purchase on such Third Party Platforms, and further
to this you acknowledge that all transactions through Open List, once
initiated by smart contract (as the case may be), on the Third Party Platform
are final. We do not make any representations or warranties about the
performance or suitability of any Third Party Platforms made available via the
NFT Marketplace through Open List, including any applicable third party terms
and conditions associated with your use of the Third Party Platform (which
shall apply to your use of such Third Party Platform as contemplated in these
terms) and you bear responsibility for reviewing, understanding and assessing
the relationship with any Third Party Platforms that you use to sell any NFTs.
Access to Third Party Platforms and Open List is provided as a convenience and
for your user benefit only; it do not constitute an endorsement or an approval
by Binance of any of the Third Party Platform, the third party exchanges or
their broader products, the services or opinions of the third party exchanges,
or the quality or reputability of the third party organization or individuals
involved in their operation. Binance bears no responsibility for the accuracy,
legality or content of Third Party Platform or for that of subsequent links or
transactions on that Third Party Platform.

41\. You agree that you are responsible for understanding and accepting any
fees charged by the Third Party Platform in respect of any transaction
initiated through Open List. Binance may, at its discretion, also charge a fee
for the Open List feature, and any such fee shall be indicated to you prior to
initiating an Open List transaction.

N. Clarification

42\. The Binance NFT Marketplace does not deal in NFTs which are "crypto-
assets" as defined by the Japanese Payment Services Act, Japanese Financial
Services Agency (JFSA) and/or any related regulatory rules or frameworks (the
“Japanese Regulations”). Further to, and in addition to the foregoing, the use
of an NFT as a means of payment is prohibited by these NFT Marketplace Terms
to the extent such prohibition is consistent with ensuring that the NFT does
not fall within the definition of a “crypto asset” as defined by applicable
Japanese Regulations.

O. Bixel

43\. The Binance NFT Marketplace has made available a feature that allows you
to upload a picture and/or input a sentence, in order to generate a computer
generated image using a randomised AI image generator algorithm provided by a
third-party open software (https://stability.ai/) (“Bixel”). You understand
that Binance does not control review, approve, monitor, endorse, warrant, or
make any representations with respect to this third-party AI image generator
open software or any of its outputs, and that this feature is provided for
convenience and for your use at your own risk ; it does not constitute an
endorsement or an approval by Binance of any third party or their broader
products, services or opinions.

44\. Bixel can be used within the Binance NFT Marketplace in accordance with
the Terms herein and in order to mint a computer generated NFT (“Bixel NFT”).
By minting a Bixel NFT, you acknowledge and agree that you have read and
accept the NFT Minting Rules. The NFT Minting Rules include examples of
inappropriate content and our right at our sole discretion to, among other
things, delist or otherwise remove your NFT collection(s) or Bixel NFTs from
the Binance NFT Marketplace.

45\. We may restrict the number of times you can generate an image with Bixel,
or otherwise charge you a minting or generation fee, which is payable from and
will be charged to your Binance Account at the point at which you generate the
image.

46\. We provide Bixel in accordance with these terms and specifically with
reference to Section K, for the purposes of which Bixel shall be deemed Third
Party Materials.

P. Bitcoin NFTs

47\. The Binance NFT Marketplace may make available to you NFTs and NFT Media
based on the Bitcoin Ordinals Protocol as applicable to the Bitcoin network
(“BTC NFTs”). We reserve the right to provide BTC NFTs to you in accordance
with our own specific internal processes and procedures, including (without
limitation), the assignment of a unique Bitcoin Wallet to each Binance user
account. You acknowledge and agree that due to the immutable and irreversible
nature of the Bitcoin network, any such transactions that you enter into in
respect of BTC NFTs on the Bitcoin network shall be final, without any right
given to you to reverse the transaction. You acknowledge that in the event
that you deposit any BTC NFT into the wrong address or deposit them into a BTC
spot address, the BTC NFT and associated assets will be irretrievable. You
agree that you will take all necessary precautions and steps to ensure that
any transactions you enter into with respect to BTC NFTs are entered into with
full understanding of the aforementioned transaction finality. Should you
determine that you have entered into an erroneous or otherwise incorrect
transaction with respect to BTC NFTs you agree that Binance shall be absolved
from any and all liability resulting.
