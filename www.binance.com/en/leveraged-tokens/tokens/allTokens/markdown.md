FAQs

  * 1. What are Binance Leveraged Tokens?

Binance Leveraged Tokens are a type of derivative product that give you
leveraged exposure to the underlying asset. Like other tokens, leveraged
tokens can be traded on the spot market. Each leveraged token represents a
basket of perpetual contract positions. The price of a leveraged token moves
along with price changes in the perpetual contract market, and the leverage
level moves up and down accordingly.

Unlike margin trading, leveraged tokens allow you to gain exposure to
leveraged positions without having to put up any collateral, maintain a
maintenance margin level, or worry about the risk of liquidation. However,
even though you don't have to worry about the risk of liquidation, there are
still risks associated with leveraged token positions, such as the effects of
price movements in the perpetual contracts market, premiums, and funding
rates.

  * 2. What is the leverage level of Binance Leveraged Tokens?

Unlike conventional leveraged tokens (not managed by Binance), Binance
Leveraged Tokens do not maintain constant leverage. Instead, Binance Leveraged
Tokens attempt to maintain a variable target leverage range between 1.25x and
4x. This would maximize profitability on upswings and minimize losses to avoid
liquidation. However, do note that the real leverage may fluctuate beyond the
target range in extreme market movements.

  * 3. What is the Underlying Asset?

The ticker name indicates the underlying assets. For example, the underlying
asset of BTCUP is the BTC perpetual contract in Binance Futures.

  * 4. Do Binance Leveraged Tokens rebalance?

Binance Leveraged Tokens rebalance on an as-needed basis only. Unlike
conventional leveraged tokens, Binance Leveraged Tokens are not forced to
maintain a constant leverage. Hence, Binance Leveraged Tokens rebalance during
extreme market movements only.

The rebalancing of Binance Leveraged Tokens positions is governed by Binance
proprietary algorithms. Binance aims to maximize the correlation between the
Binance Leveraged Tokens and the underlying margin-Leveraged position.

  * 5. How do I get started in Binance Leveraged Tokens?

You must accept and agree to the terms and conditions in Binance Leveraged
Token Risk Disclosure before getting started in Binance Leveraged Tokens.

  * 6. I couldn’t find the trading pair of leveraged tokens I want to trade in the Binance spot market. Will Binance add them?

You can find a list of leveraged token trading pairs available to trade on
Binance here. Should we add more trading pairs for trading, an official
announcement will be made in advance.

  * 7. What are the fees associated with Binance Leveraged Tokens?

The fees associated with Binance Leveraged Tokens are as follows:  

i. **Trading fees:** Trading fees are charged when buying or selling tokens in
the spot market, and the fee schedule is identical to spot trading.

ii. **Subscription fees:** Subscription fees are charged when users choose to
subscribe tokens, which is currently set at 0.1% per subscription.

iii. **Redemption fees:** Redemption fees are charged when users choose to
redeem tokens, which is currently set at 0.1% per redemption.

iv. **Management fees:** A daily management fee of 0.01% will be charged at
00:00 UTC and reflected directly in the net asset value of the leveraged
tokens;

v. **Funding fees:** Funding fees are paid (or paid to) the underlying fund
based on the funding rate and reflected directly in the net asset value of the
Leveraged tokens. Binance takes no fees for funding rate transfers; these are
directly between traders.

  * 8. How to subscribe or redeem?

To subscribe or redeem, simply go to Binance Leveraged Tokens page and click
“Subscribe” or “Redeem”. 0.1% of subscription or redemption fee will be
charged and the funds (in USDT) will be deducted from or credited into your
spot wallet.

The daily total subscription or redemption limit of each leveraged token may
vary according to prevailing market conditions.

Users may subscribe or redeem each leveraged token up to the daily cap per
account at any time except during rebalancing, however, the amount may vary
according to prevailing market conditions. Please refer to [Binance Leveraged
Tokens Trading Rules](/en/support/faq/73c39e149c90425dbbab242cbb443685) for
the limit of subscription and redemption.

Users are not allowed to redeem tokens while the fund is rebalancing.

  * 9. Can I withdraw Binance Leveraged Tokens to my wallet?

Currently, Binance Leveraged Tokens are not withdrawable. You can store the
tokens safely on your Binance account.
