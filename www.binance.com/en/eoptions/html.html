This graphical representation is called a dollar token, and the dollar token maintains a 1:1 relationship with the fiat currency it represents.\u003cbr/\u003eBecause a system of electronic credits has been created for the dollar, the underlying dollar never needs to leave the account, which means no bank needs to approve loans for the token.
