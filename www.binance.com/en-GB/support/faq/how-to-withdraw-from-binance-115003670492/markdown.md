## How to withdraw crypto on the Binance App?

1\. Log in to your Binance App and tap **[Wallets]** \- **[Spot]** \-
**[Withdraw]**.

![](https://public.bnbstatic.com/image/cms/article/body/202303/7a5c311ea935a61191640a2efdfdefb9.png)

2\. Choose the cryptocurrency you want to withdraw, for example, BNB. Then,
tap **[Send via Crypto Network]**.

![](https://public.bnbstatic.com/image/cms/article/body/202303/ccc8c94ba8c99e5c537ba2815534529f.png)

3\. Paste the address you want to withdraw to and select the network.

Please choose the network carefully and **make sure that the selected network
is the same as the network of the platform you are withdrawing funds to.** If
you select the wrong network, your funds might be lost and couldn’t be
recovered.

![](https://public.bnbstatic.com/image/cms/article/body/202303/737fff800b763f007ca065ae850a2d09.jpeg)

### How to choose a network?

  * BEP2 refers to the BNB Beacon Chain (former Binance Chain).
  * BEP20 refers to the BNB Smart Chain (BSC) (former Binance Smart Chain).
  * ERC20 refers to the Ethereum network. Its native cryptocurrency is ETH.
  * TRC20 refers to the TRON network.
  * EOS refers to the Enterprise Operation System network.
  * BTC refers to the Bitcoin network.
  * BTC (SegWit) refers to Native Segwit (bech32), and the address starts with “bc1”. You can withdraw or send Bitcoin to SegWit (bech32) addresses. For more details, please refer to [About Segregated Witness (SegWit)](/en-GB/support/faq/0a6fcbc99a87424481c08bd894601759).

_For certain networks, such as BEP2 or EOS, you must fill in the Memo when
making a transfer, or your address cannot be detected._

  * The network selection depends on the options provided by the external wallet/exchange that you are making the withdrawal. If the external platform only supports ERC20, you must select the ERC20 deposit network.
  * DO NOT select the cheapest fee option. **Select the one that is compatible with the external platform.** For example, you can only send ERC20 tokens to another ERC20 address, and you can only send BSC tokens to another BSC address. If you select incompatible/different deposit networks, you will lose your funds.
  * You should also **confirm that the receiving platform supports the contract address of the token you’re withdrawing** , or your assets might be lost and cannot be recovered. You can check the list of supporting contract addresses from the respective platform.

4\. Enter the withdrawal amount and you will see the corresponding transaction
fee and the final amount you will receive. You can also select which wallet to
withdraw from by tapping **[Spot & Funding Wallet]. **Tap **[Withdraw]** to
proceed.

![](https://public.bnbstatic.com/image/cms/article/body/202303/90732ddbc781a3a9cb8092f6448a6473.jpeg)

5\. You will be prompted to confirm the transaction again. Please check
carefully before tapping **[Confirm]**.

If you enter the wrong information or select the wrong network when making a
transfer, your assets will be permanently lost. **Please make sure the
information is correct before you confirm the transaction.**

![](https://public.bnbstatic.com/image/cms/article/body/202303/5d1a03845990f22d73edd4d05cc9046a.png)

6\. Verify the transaction with your 2FA devices. After confirming the
withdrawal request, please wait patiently for the transfer to be processed.

If the exchange/platform doesn’t support the token, please select another
network. **You are recommended to confirm the supported networks with the
receiving exchange/platform before proceeding** , or your assets might be lost
and couldn’t be recovered.

on Binance, it takes time for the transaction to be confirmed on the

GB/glossary/confirmation-time) varies depending on the blockchain and its
network traffic. Please wait patiently for the transfer to be processed.

4\. Enter an address label (a customized name for your own reference). Then,
select the coin and network. You may also save it as a universal address
without specifying the coin. A universal address can be used to withdraw all
coins that match its network. Check the box next to **[Set as a universal
address, without specific coins.]**.

![](https://public.bnbstatic.com/image/cms/article/body/202303/e80ca9c4b4b90d5aeba1a2db13d07a41.png)

identifies whether the address is from an exchange or a wallet.

![](https://public.bnbstatic.com/image/cms/article/body/202303/826262f8202ce8d3ee958ece07e71bf6.png)

You might need to enter a MEMO. For example, you need to provide the MEMO when
sending funds to another Binance account or to another exchange. You do not
need a MEMO when sending funds to a Trust Wallet address.

**Make sure to double-check if a MEMO is required or not. If a MEMO is
required and you fail to provide it, you may lose your funds.** Note that some
platforms and wallets refer to the MEMO as Tag or Payment ID.

6\. You can also add the address to your whitelist by checking the box next to
**[Whitelisted]**. When whitelist is enabled, your account will only be able
to withdraw to whitelisted withdrawal addresses. Click **[Save]** and complete
2FA.

![](https://public.bnbstatic.com/image/cms/article/body/202303/18e6e1b2639d8cc4b6d78e3acce5f14f.png)

7\. Your address will be added.
