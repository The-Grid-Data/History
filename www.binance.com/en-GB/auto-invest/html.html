The income will be calculated at 8:00 AM on the 10th, and the spot wallet will receive the previous days lock-up income after 8:00 AM on the 11th; Users who redeem in advance at 16:00 PM on the 12th will deduct the two-day paid income from the principal; therefore reducing the principal payout amount.","lending-defi-faqAnswer9":"Redemption requires 1 day to unlock. This is because  users' staked assets are used to participate in the on-chain  smart contract. Redemption and distribution also take a  certain period of time to fufill. For example, user A  redeemed a BNB based DeFi Staking at 21:00 on  September 9th with an unlock period of 24 hours. The  unlock period will begin at 8:00 AM (UTC) on September  10th, and end at 8:00 AM on September 11th.
