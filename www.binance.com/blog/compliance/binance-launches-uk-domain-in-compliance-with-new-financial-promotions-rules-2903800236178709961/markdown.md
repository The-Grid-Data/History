# Binance Launches UK Domain in Compliance with New Financial Promotions Rules

2023-10-06

![](https://public.bnbstatic.com/image/cms/blog/20231006/0d0075b6-5c35-4234-abcb-1dcfe94a23b7.png)  
In compliance with the updated Financial Promotions Regime, Binance has
launched a new domain for UK users and partnered with Rebuildingsociety.com
Limited which will approve Binance’s marketing and communications materials.
Rebuildingsociety.com is an FCA  regulated firm which is authorised to approve
crypto marketing and communications materials as an ‘S21 approver’. This
partnership and new domain means that we can offer services in the UK in
compliance with the updated Financial Promotions Rules.

UK retail users will now be redirected to [_www.binance.com/en-
GB_](http://www.binance.com/en-GB) , which will only show Binance products and
services that we can offer in compliance with UK regulations. These include:

  * Fiat and crypto deposits and withdrawals

  * Spot Trading 

  * Margin Trading

  * Convert

  * NFT marketplace

  * Binance Pay

  * Crypto Loans

  * Launchpad

Our compliance with the Financial Promotions Regime means that certain
products will no longer be available to UK retail users, for example:

  * Gift Cards

  * Academy 

  * Research 

  * Feed

  * Referral bonuses

These changes only apply to retail users in the UK from 8 October 2023, and
will not affect users which are exempt under the new Financial Promotions
Regime (such as certain institutional and professional investors).

Compliance with regulation around the world remains a top priority for
Binance. We are pleased that our partnership with Rebuildingsociety.com allows
us to meet our regulatory commitments in the UK and provide uninterrupted
service to our users.
