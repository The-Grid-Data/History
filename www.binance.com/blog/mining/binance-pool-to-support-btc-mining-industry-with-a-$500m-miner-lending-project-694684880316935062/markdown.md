As one of the world’s leading crypto mining pools, Binance Pool has a
responsibility to help maintain a healthy digital asset ecosystem. In light of
current market conditions, Binance Pool is launching a $500million lending
project to support crypto miners and digital infrastructure providers.

The first of its kind for Binance Pool, this project was designed to provide
secure debt financing services to both public and private blue-chip bitcoin
(BTC) mining and digital asset infrastructure companies globally.

## Miner Lending Project Summary

### 1\. Provide access to $500 million worth of loans

Eligible borrowers will be required to agree to our terms & conditions,
including but not limited to:

a. an 18 to 24-month term

b. interest rates ranging from 5% to 10%; and

c. offering security, either physical or digital assets, satisfactory to
Binance.

Interested in getting a loan? [Contact us today](mailto:poolvip@binance.com).

infrastructure providers, Binance Pool is looking for cloud mining vendors to
work with us.
