## What You Need to Know

Binance is introducing new fiat partners to provide EUR services to users in
Europe. We have signed agreements with a number of new regulated and
authorized fiat partners to provide a variety of fiat services to our
community.  Users have already started being migrated to the new services.

Fiat services offered by these new fiat partners to our users include:

  * EUR deposit and withdrawal via Open Banking and SEPA/SEPA Instant

  * buying and selling crypto via SEPA/SEPA Instant

  * buying and selling crypto with bank cards

  * buying and selling crypto with fiat balances

  * EUR spot pairs for all users

## Why Are Fiat Partners So Important?

Being able to easily convert fiat to crypto, and back to fiat again, is a
crucial part of advancing the adoption of digital assets globally. Without an
easy way to buy or sell crypto, users who are new to the space can find the
process of buying or selling crypto unintuitive and intimidating. Offering
fiat services provides essential ease of use to all participants in the crypto
ecosystem.

For a centralized exchange, ease of use and growing crypto adoption are
principal goals. Having fiat ‘on-ramps’ and ‘off-ramps’ is key to a good user
experience and enabling access to Web3 ecosystems for new users and crypto
natives alike.

Binance’s mission is to increase the freedom of money globally, and having
partners that enable us to meet this goal is crucial. The majority of our
users around the world now have easy access to crypto through our fiat partner
relationships, giving them the freedom to choose exactly how they use their
money.
