# Your Binance Fan Club Experience Just Got Even Better

2023-04-03

## Main Takeaways

  * [Binance Fan Club](https://www.binance.com/en/fan-token/team-profile/lazio/bfc?ref=NO5BA53I&utm_source=fan-token&utm_medium=ft-blog-body&utm_campaign=ft-fan-club-update&registerChannel=BFC) lets you engage with your favorite sports teams, celebrities, and stars in return for exclusive rewards.

  * From new rewards to rules and features, we’ve already significantly improved the Fan Club experience since its launch with your help and feedback.

_Our Fan Club is a great way to get up close and personal when it comes to
unmissable fan experiences. We’re always looking to give even more by
listening to your thoughts and suggestions.  _

![](https://public.bnbstatic.com/image/cms/blog/20230403/d9f4c354-befe-43cf-9ff8-46c52d3fd65f)

Fan Tokens aren’t just an investment. They’re also a fantastic way to interact
with your favorite teams, sports stars, and celebrities. Every Fan Token you
own gives you the right to participate in one-of-a-kind experiences that true
fans dream of. But once you have your tokens, how can you engage with your
chosen team or star even more? Step forward, Binance Fan Club!

## What is Binance Fan Club, and How Is It Related to Fan Tokens?

[Binance Fan Club](https://www.binance.com/en/fan-token/team-
profile/lazio/fan-profile?ref=NO5BA53I&utm_source=fan-token&utm_medium=ft-
blog-body&utm_campaign=ft-fan-club&registerChannel=BFC) is your go-to place
for boosting your Fan Token experiences. The concept is simple: the more you
engage with your team, the more you’re rewarded. Taking part in polls,
inviting friends, and even verifying your identity can also earn your Fan
Token rewards. [Every completed task gains you Star
Points](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/how-to-join-binance-fan-club-
on-binance-fan-token-9dc1bd181b0d44a285f564bb50b0191a) to level up and access
even larger rewards. New users can participate in the fun without holding any
Fan Tokens, while existing users need at least one Fan Token in their Binance
wallet.

Since its launch at the end of February 2023, over 17,000 people have joined
in the fun, with more than 6,000 rewards distributed. Participants have
received token vouchers, merchandise, and even fan experiences to share with
their team, sports star, or celebrity.

Just look at a selection of March’s lineup for a taste of what’s on offer!

**Team**| **Rewards**  
---|---

## Our Binance Fan Club Experience Is Constantly Improving

Despite Binance Fan Club’s short time on the scene, it's already undergone
extensive upgrades and improvements. For Binance, one key to the Fan Token
experience is the fanbase itself. That’s why we eagerly take on user feedback
to improve the service and its usability.

For example, one of the most common questions we received was about claiming
rewards. We soon realized the community was keen to claim their rewards before
an activity’s end, and we subsequently implemented their suggestion.

It’s not just about service improvements either. We also want your input on
new rewards and features you’re craving! Currently, we’re preparing a whole
new selection of prizes for April and increasing the number of tasks for users
to claim points with. If you’ve got some great ideas, [fill out our
survey](https://www.binance.com/en/survey/01c88d5f7b574349b26bdca740ac8ba5)
and make yourself heard!

## Get Closer to Your Favorite Teams With Unmissable Opportunities

Our Fan Club is just one way Fan Token holders can interact with their
favorite teams, players, and stars. Fan Tokens have a wide variety of use
cases, so make sure to explore them all if you already have some in your
portfolio.

We look forward to seeing you soon at the Fan Club and introducing you to even
more features and rewards over the upcoming months!
