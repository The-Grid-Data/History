# Binance to issue up to $100 USD in BNB to registered users in the Hurricane-
Impacted Acapulco Region

2023-10-31

![](https://public.bnbstatic.com/image/cms/blog/20231031/2976c8c3-d534-4640-958f-6cb4a7f0a449.jpeg)

In response to the devastation caused by the recent Hurricane Otis in
Acapulco, Mexico and the surrounding area, [_Binance
Charity_](https://www.binance.charity/) will issue up to $100 USD in BNB token
vouchers to registered Binance users identified as living in the areas
affected by the tragedy.

Identification of the users will be based on Proof of Address (POA) completed
on and before October 25, 2023, in Acapulco, Guerrero State, which has
suffered the most significant impact. Users who have completed POA before this
date in Acapulco will each receive $100 USD in BNB token vouchers in their
[_Rewards HUb_](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/how-to-redeem-token-
voucher-8fb78721e97b4138b90b51239f41a9aa).

We recognize that many users in the affected area of Acapulco may not have yet
completed POA. Therefore, for any existing user who completes POA after
October 25, 2023 and before November 25, 2023, we will issue $25 USD in BNB
token vouchers to their accounts.

The funds will start reaching users on November 1, 2023.

In the aftermath of natural disasters, people often lose access to traditional
banking at the exact moment when extra funds are needed to help cover medical
supplies, food, and other essential needs.

Crypto transfers are now increasingly being used to deliver financial aid to
disaster victims as they provide fast, low-cost, borderless, and transparent
transactions.

In these difficult times, Binance stands by our users, and we will continue to
work on additional ways to help our community in Mexico.

page_](https://www.binance.charity/posts/99).
