Affected Children in Ukraine

2024-04-02

## Main Takeaways

  * Binance Charity has partnered with the Children of Heroes Foundation to alleviate trauma and facilitate emotional recovery for children affected by the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.

  * This collaboration will launch a 12-day therapeutic camp named “I Am da Vinci” to support children who have lost their parents in the war through a blend of activities emphasizing recovery, bonding, and psychological support.

  * Since the early days of the war in 2022, Binance Charity’s humanitarian efforts in Ukraine have proven the effectiveness of Web3 innovations in disaster relief and philanthropy.

The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has had a devastating effect on the country’s
civilian population. As of the end of February 2024, the UN Office of the High
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has confirmed the deaths of [_over
10,670 civilians_](https://ukraine.un.org/en/264355-report-human-rights-
situation-ukraine-1-december-2023-29-february-2024) since the Russian
Federation first launched its full-scale attack on February 24, 2022. In the
wake of these numbers, many children have lost close friends and family,
creating a new wave of generational trauma.

To help provide relief to these children and facilitate their journey of
emotional recovery, [_Binance Charity_](https://www.binance.charity/) has
teamed up with the [_Children of Heroes
Foundation_](https://childrenheroes.org/) , a Ukrainian charity fund
supporting children affected by the war. Through this collaboration, we will
run a 12-day therapeutic camp named “I Am da Vinci” to aid children who have
tragically lost their parents in the ongoing conflict.

## “I Am da Vinci” Camp

The shared initiative between Binance Campus and Children of Heroes Foundation
aims to foster a safe, friendly environment to help war-affected children
overcome their trauma. The “I Am da Vinci” camp will offer a unique blend of
activities and resources emphasizing emotional recovery, community bonding,
and psychological support while stimulating a sense of adventure.

> _Every child deserves the love and security of a family. At Binance, we are
> more than willing to support initiatives aimed at alleviating their
> suffering and restoring hope. In every child we help, we see a brighter
> future, not just for Ukraine but for the entire world. Our commitment to
> providing compassionate assistance is not a choice but a responsibility we
> wholeheartedly embrace._ – Kyrylo Khomiakov, Binance Regional Head for CEE &
> Central Asia

Grieving children attending the camp will gain opportunities to articulate
their experiences through various creative means, including activities,
competitions, and tasks promoting self-expression and intellectual growth.
Essential psychological counseling services will be provided throughout the
camp to help process emotions, understand losses, and cope with the impacts of
traumatic experiences.

By creating a safe and nurturing space, the program aims to mitigate feelings
of isolation and loneliness, allowing children to form strong bonds with
others who share similar experiences. Support for this camp has been generated
through Binance Charity donations. A total of 50,000 USDT (approximately
2,000,000 UAH) will be used to help facilitate the event, proving to be an
instrumental source of funding for this initiative.

## Children of Heroes Foundation

Founded by a passionate businessman named Danylo Pasko in the early days of
the conflict on March 2, 2022, the [_Children of Heroes
Foundation_](https://childrenheroes.org/en/) has been instrumental in
providing aid to war-affected children in Ukraine. Having lost his own father
when he was a child, Danylo formed a team that shared his values and desire to
help children who had lost their parents in the large-scale war. The idea
quickly garnered support from other Ukrainian citizens, public figures, and
entrepreneurs, and in April 2022, the foundation officially commenced its
operations.

> _The war has hurt the emotional and psychological state of children,
> especially those who are experiencing the loss of their loved ones. Our
> beneficiaries have faced various psychological traumas, and if they do not
> work with specialists now, the consequences can manifest themselves for
> years. The mission of our fund is to ensure that all of our beneficiaries
> are integrated into society and have every opportunity to build a successful
> life. Therefore, organizing such camps, where children will work with
> psychologists and recover from difficult experiences, is one of the most
> crucial areas of our activity. We want to see the smiling faces of children
> who enjoy their childhood or youth again, not crying eyes, despair, and
> irritation. Children are our future, so we must care for them and provide
> all the support they need at the right time._ – Tetiana Novytska, Children
> of Heroes Foundation CEO

## Binance Charity in Ukraine

In the early days of Russia’s invasion, Binance Charity created a crowd-funded
[_Emergency Relief Fund_](https://www.binance.charity/projects/38/Humanity-
First---Ukraine-Emergency-Relief-Fund) to provide immediate support and safe
havens for refugees fleeing conflict zones and other victims trapped in the
country. This included an initial donation of $10,000,000 from Binance, one of
the largest donations to Ukraine by a private company.

Since then, we have been working hard with multinational and local
organizations on the ground, including UNHCR and UNICEF, to disseminate funds
in the most effective ways. These have included providing shelter, food, safe
drinking water, medical supplies, cash assistance, and psychological support.

Through our efforts, we have proven that cryptocurrencies can serve as a
[_transformative force_](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/charity/how-crypto-
can-transform-charitable-giving-3187406124285774725) in the realm of
charitable giving. We will continue to show how Web3 can be utilized
effectively to deliver aid in innovative ways. To support this mission, please
consider donating to our Ukraine initiative or any of our [_other
projects_](https://www.binance.charity/projects). Every donation, however big
or small, will make a real impact on the lives of others and showcase the
benefits of Web3 philanthropy.
