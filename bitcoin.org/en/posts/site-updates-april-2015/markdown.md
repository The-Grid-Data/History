# Site Updates In March 2015

_Thanks to[our volunteers](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-
org/bitcoin.org/graphs/contributors?from=2015-03-01&to=2015-03-31&type=c) and
the financial sponsorship of [The Bitcoin
Foundation](https://bitcoinfoundation.org/), we made the following
accomplishments this month._

  * **No more broken links:** all internal links on Bitcoin.orgâs 834 pages are now automatically checked by [HTML Proofer](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer) through our [Travis Continuous Integration (CI)](https://travis-ci.org/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org) infrastructure. We plan to enable HTML Prooferâs HTML validation subroutine in the future to provide even better quality assurance. Thanks to HTML Proofer author [Garen Torikian](https://github.com/gjtorikian) for writing such a great tool!

  * **Coinapult wallet** was briefly removed from the Bitcoin.org [Choose Your Wallet](/en/choose-your-wallet) page after they suffered a security breach. After restoring full services to their customers and assuring us that customer deposits are safe, we re-added them.

  * **KnC wallet** has been removed from the Choose Your Wallet page after multiple issues, including an abandoned website, no new commits to [their codebase](https://github.com/kncgroup/bitcoin-wallet) in several months, and reports that their iOS app no longer worked. (In positive news, we have received reports that it is still possible to recover funds from the wallet seed.)

  * **Translations** were updated thanks to translation volunteers on [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/bitcoinorg/).

  * **Seven new events** were added. Please check the [Events page](/en/events) to see whether there are any interesting Bitcoin meetups or conferences in your area.

  * **New pages & features:** a [developer documentation](https://developer.bitcoin.org/) glossary section and Javascript-based search engine were [proposed](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/793) but not quite finished by the end of the month.

## Site Traffic

According to or [website statistics](https://bitcoin.org/stats/2015-03.html),
4.3 million people visited the website in March. However, as seen in the
illustration below, there was a suspicious spike in visits that look like a
possible attempt at [referer spam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referer_spam)
(even though we donât publish referer information). Almost all of the
suspicious traffic was directed at the Spanish, Dutch, and French Bitcoin.org
home pages, leaving statistics for the rest of the site fairly accurate.

We suspect the accurate number of unique visitors in March was around 2.0
million, roughly the same as in February.

![March traffic statistics graph](/img/blog/free/stats-2015-03.png?1716491272)

Notable traffic patterns this month included:

  * The [Full Node Guide](/en/full-node) first released last month received over 8,000 page views, a surprisingly high number for a new technical document. Hopefully this is a sign that users really want to run full nodes for themselves.

  * The [Choose Your Wallet page](/en/choose-your-wallet) continues to receive over 130,000 page views a month, as it keeps on trying to help novice users choose their first Bitcoin wallet.

  * The [Bitcoin Core Download page](/en/download) has just as many page views as it did last month (75,000) when Bitcoin Core 0.10.0 was released. If you havenât upgraded yet to get new features like [headers-first block sync](https://developer.bitcoin.org/devguide/p2p_network.html#headers-first) and [lower vulnerability to OpenSSL code changes](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0066.mediawiki), take some time to read the [0.10.0 release notes](/en/release/v0.10.0) to see what youâre missing.
