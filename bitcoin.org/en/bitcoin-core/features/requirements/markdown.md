Bitcoin Core gives you increased [security](/en/bitcoin-
core/features/validation) and [privacy](/en/bitcoin-core/features/privacy) at
a cost. You need to take responsibility for the security of your bitcoins,
meet higher minimum system requirements, and beware of some possible problems.

**No matter what Bitcoin software you use,** you should never buy more
bitcoins than you can afford to lose. Bitcoin is still an experimental system
and bitcoins remain a risky investment.

## Wallet Responsibility Checklist

Bitcoin Core puts you in charge of your wallet, which means your bitcoins are
at risk unless you complete certain tasks:

  * Backup your keys

  * Make sure your wallet is secure

  * Setup an offline wallet (cold storage) for significant amounts of bitcoins

  * Watch for [security notifications](/en/alerts)

  * Allow your heirs to receive your bitcoins if you die or become incapacitated

If you need help with any step, please ask for assistance in any of
Bitcoinâs [friendly forums](/en/bitcoin-core/help#forums) or [live
chatrooms](/en/bitcoin-core/help#live).

## Possible Problems

  * **Legal:** Bitcoin use is [prohibited or restricted in some areas.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_bitcoin_by_country)

  * **Bandwidth limits** : Some Internet plans will charge an additional amount for any excess upload bandwidth used that isnât included in the plan. Worse, some providers may terminate your connection without warning because of overuse. We advise that you check whether your Internet connection is subjected to such limitations and monitor your bandwidth use so that you can stop Bitcoin Core before you reach your upload limit.

  * **Anti-virus:** Several people have placed parts of known computer viruses in the Bitcoin block chain. This block chain data canât infect your computer, but some anti-virus programs quarantine the data anyway, making it more difficult to run Bitcoin Core. This problem mostly affects computers running Windows.

  * **Attack target:** Bitcoin Core powers the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network, so people who want to disrupt the network may attack Bitcoin Core users in ways that will affect other things you do with your computer, such as an attack that limits your available download bandwidth.

By default, you need to backup Bitcoin Core after every 100 transactions. This
includes both transactions you send as well as payments you request (whether
or not you actually received the payment).

For example, you need to backup after sending 33 payments and requesting 67
payments (even though you only received 60 payments).

Bitcoin Core can be configured to allow you to go more transactions between
backups. See the [`-keypool`
setting](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Running_Bitcoin).

Anyone who gets access to your wallet can steal your bitcoins. The first line
of defense against this is encrypting your wallet, an option from the File
menu in the graphical interface.

However, encrypting may not be enough if your computer becomes infected by
malware. Learn about offline wallets for security against this type of attack.

In addition to securing your wallet, you also need to keep your backups
secure. Anyone who gets access to them can also steal your bitcoins.

**Learn more:** [secure your wallet](/en/secure-your-wallet)

Computers that connect to the Internet are frequently hacked or infected with
bitcoin-stealing malware. Computers that never connect to the Internet are a
much more secure location for your bitcoins.

Bitcoin Core can be run on an always-offline computer, creating an offline
wallet (also called a cold wallet). The offline wallet will securely store the
private keys, while a separate online Bitcoin Core wallet will send and
receive transactions.

**Learn more:** [Creating and signing offline
transactions](http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/34122/21052)

Your Bitcoin wallet isnât like a bank accountâit wonât automatically go
to your heirs if you die or become disabled.

You have to plan ahead and make sure there is a way for your heirs to access
your wallet backups when youâre no longer available.

inheritable?](http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/q/38692/21052)
