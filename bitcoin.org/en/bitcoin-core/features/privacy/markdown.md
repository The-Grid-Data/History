Every confirmed Bitcoin transaction is published to the block chain where
anyone can see it. So **why do people still use Bitcoin?** And why do many of
them believe that Bitcoin is a private way of sending money?

One reason is that Bitcoin Core and some other Bitcoin software tries to avoid
associating your real-world identity with the transactions you make. The
difference looks like this:

![Privacy difference: pseudonymous transactions](/img/bitcoin-core/privacy-
difference.svg?1716491272)

The second type of transaction (a pseudonymous transaction) only provides
practical privacy if nobody can figure out that â5a35bâ is really Alice.
Itâs up to your wallet to prevent anyone from making that connection. See
below for how Bitcoin Coreâs privacy compares to other wallets.

## No Sign-Up Required

Third-party Bitcoin services can both increase and decrease your privacy. They
can increase it by mixing your transactions with those of other users; they
can decrease it by tracking your activity and directly associating it with
your real name or other identifying information.

Click an entry below to show it:

BitGo

Who knows your information? **Just you** or also a **service provider?**  
---  
| Bitcoin Core | BitGo  
Your real name |  |   
Your bitcoin balance |  |   
Who you pay, and/or who pays you (in some cases) |  |   
How much you spend and/or receive |  |   
The IP address your connection came from |  |   
Who can guess your information? **Just you** or also **people you trade
with?**  
| Bitcoin Core | BitGo  
Other transactions you made or received |  |   
  
## Perfect Privacy for Received Transactions

There are 230 million transactions on the Bitcoin block chain. How do you find
which ones pay you? Here are some common options:

**Ask bankers**  
Theyâll monitor your every transaction  
  
Bitcoin banks | **Ask random nodes**  
Some of which sell your data  
  
P2P lightweight wallets  
---|---  
**Ask a free service**  
(Actually, some do care about privacy)  
  
Client lightweight wallets | **Get all 230 million transactions**  
For **perfect** receiving privacy  
  
**Bitcoin Core**  
  
Bitcoin Core downloads all 230 million transactions on the Bitcoin block chain
and processes them to find which transactions pay you.

This currently takes about 4 hours the first time you start Bitcoin Core and
about 5 minutes a day to keep updated, but it gives you what scientists call
**information-theoretic (perfect) privacy** against eavesdroppers for received
transactions.

## Strong Privacy for Sent Transactions

To put a transaction on the block chain, you must send it publiclyâbut how
you send it can make a big difference.

![Sending privacy](/img/bitcoin-core/sending-privacy.svg?1716491272)

**Can you guess who made which transactions?** Nearly all peer-to-peer
lightweight clients today make no attempt to obscure their sent transactions.
They simply send them to some or all of their peers.

Bitcoin Core does much better. By default, it relays transactions for all of
its peersâthousands of separate transactions a day under common
conditionsâwhich allows it both [support the peer-to-peer
network](/en/bitcoin-core/features/network-support) and confuse anti-privacy
organizations that try to track your transactions.

## Tor Compatible

The Tor anonymity network helps disassociate your online activity from your IP
address (which is often closely associated with your real name). This
significantly increases your ability to confound anti-privacy organizations.

Once you [setup Tor](https://www.torproject.org/), using it with Bitcoin Core
is [easy](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Tor). If you also [setup a Tor hidden
service](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Tor#Hidden_services), you will be able to
[connect mobile clients](/en/bitcoin-core/features/user-interface#lightweight)
to your Bitcoin Core full node for increased security and privacy wherever you
go.

[Start using Tor today](https://www.torproject.org/)

## Decentralized Peer Discovery

The first time any Bitcoin program connects to the peer-to-peer network, it
has to ask a centralized authority for a list of recommended peers.

Once the program gets on the network, it can ask its peers for more
recommendations in a fully decentralized wayâbut most lightweight wallets
donât bother.

P2P Lightweight Wallets | Bitcoin Core  
---|---  
Asks the same centralized services every time program is restarted. This can be faster. | Uses the peer-to-peer network to independently discover new peers. Uses found peers on restart.  
  
This allows the centralized authority to connect lightweight wallets to
dishonest peers that can **completely destroy lightweight transaction
privacy.** Those dishonest peers can work with dishonest miners to **weaken
lightweight security too.**

Bitcoin Core prefers decentralized peer discovery, so after the first time it
starts, it no longer has to trust the centralized authority. Isnât that
worth occasionally starting up a few seconds slower?

![Bitcoin Core receiving privacy features](/img/bitcoin-core/bank-receiving-
privacy.svg?1716491272)

When you receive bitcoins to a Bitcoin bank, the money is sent to one of the
bankâs addressesânot your ownâwhich can give you excellent privacy
against random strangers.

However, the bank knows you received the transaction and they can likely also
see any information you associate with the transaction, such as the senderâs
name or another note you attach to the transaction.

The bank may also be required by law to disclose information about your
account. They can also sell your information or have a hacker steal your
information.

![Receiving privacy](/img/bitcoin-core/receiving-privacy.svg?1716491272)

By only asking for payments related to your wallet, plus maybe a few others as
bloom filter camouflage, lightweight wallets may reveal who you paid, who paid
you, and what your current bitcoin balance is.

> A [2014 study of lightweight clients](http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.6079) said,
> âOur results show that bloom filters incur serious privacy leakage in
> existing SPV client implementations [â¦] such an information leakage might
> severely harm the privacy of usersâ **Nearly all lightweight clients are
> still vulnerable today.**

hardâ](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/bitcoinj/Ys13qkTwcNg/9qxnhwnkeoIJ)

![Electrum-style receiving privacy](/img/bitcoin-core/electrum-receiving-
privacy.svg?1716491272)

Some lightweight wallets donât connect to the Bitcoin peer-to-peer (P2P)
network. Instead, they make a (usually secure) connection to a single server
that provides block chain data.

The wallet tells the server all of its addresses, and the server replies with
all of the transactions that belong to the wallet. This explicitly reveals all
of your addresses, which is bad for your privacyâbut it only gives that
information to one server, as long as you donât change servers later.

The server can, of course, give away your information and further reduce your
privacy. However, as of June 2017, most of these types of servers are run by
volunteers who likely want to help protect your privacy, so this model can be
more private than bank wallets or P2P lightweight wallets.

The following P2P lightweight wallets use decentralized peer discovery by
default.

  * BRD

If you know of another compliant lightweight wallet, please [tell us about
it](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues).

Information-theoretic privacy means that the privacy canât be broken even if
an attacker has unlimited computing resources.
