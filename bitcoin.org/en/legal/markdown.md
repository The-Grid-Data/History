### 1\. Information published on bitcoin.org

The website https://bitcoin.org/ (hereinafter, referred to as the "Website")
provides information and material of a general nature. You are not authorized
and nor should you rely on the Website for legal advice, business advice, or
advice of any kind. You act at your own risk in reliance on the contents of
the Website. Should you make a decision to act or not act you should contact a
licensed attorney in the relevant jurisdiction in which you want or need help.
In no way are the owners of, or contributors to, the Website responsible for
the actions, decisions, or other behavior taken or not taken by you in
reliance upon the Website.

### 2\. Translations

The Website may contain translations of the English version of the content
available on the Website. These translations are provided only as a
convenience. In the event of any conflict between the English language version
and the translated version, the English language version shall take
precedence. If you notice any inconsistency, please report them on
[GitHub](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org).

### 3\. Risks related to the use of Bitcoin

The Website will not be responsible for any losses, damages or claims arising
from events falling within the scope of the following five categories:

(1) Mistakes made by the user of any Bitcoin-related software or service,
e.g., forgotten passwords, payments sent to wrong Bitcoin addresses, and
accidental deletion of wallets.

(2) Software problems of the Website and/or any Bitcoin-related software or
service, e.g., corrupted wallet file, incorrectly constructed transactions,
unsafe cryptographic libraries, malware affecting the Website and/or any
Bitcoin-related software or service.

(3) Technical failures in the hardware of the user of any Bitcoin-related
software or service, e.g., data loss due to a faulty or damaged storage
device.

(4) Security problems experienced by the user of any Bitcoin-related software
or service, e.g., unauthorized access to users' wallets and/or accounts.

(5) Actions or inactions of third parties and/or events experienced by third
