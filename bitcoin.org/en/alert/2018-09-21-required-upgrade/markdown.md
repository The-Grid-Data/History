# Notice of Required Upgrade to 0.16.3

21 September 2018

## Summary

[0.16.3](https://bitcoin.org/en/download) was recently released, and if
youâre running a node and havenât already updated, we recommend you do so
as soon as possible. A bug fixed in 0.16.3 [is more
severe](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2018/09/20/notice/) than was previously
made public. You can download 0.16.3 from
[bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/download). As always, make sure that you
verify the authenticity of the download with [GPG](https://gnupg.org/) using
the [signing key](https://bitcoin.org/laanwj-releases.asc) and [release
signatures](https://bitcoin.org/bin/bitcoin-core-0.16.3/SHA256SUMS.asc).

**Stored funds are not at risk** , and never were at risk. Even if the bug had
been exploited to its full extent, the theoretical damage to stored funds
would have been rolled back, exactly as it was in the [value overflow
incident](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Value_overflow_incident). However, there
is currently a small risk of a chain split. In a chain split, transactions
could be reversed long after they are fully confirmed. Therefore, for the next
week or so you should consider there to be a small possibility of any
transaction with less than 200 confirmations being reversed.

Below is a summary of required action items:

  * You should not run any version of Bitcoin Core other than 0.16.3. Older versions should not exist on the network. If you know anyone who is running an older version, tell them to upgrade it as soon as possible.

  * Itâs not necessary to immediately upgrade older versions if they are currently shut down. Cold-storage wallets are safe.

  * For approximately the next week, consider transactions with fewer than 200 confirmations to have a low probability of being reversed (whereas usually there would be essentially zero probability of transactions having six or more confirmations being reversed).

  * Please watch for further news. If a chain split happens, additional action may be required.
