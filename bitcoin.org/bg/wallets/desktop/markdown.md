## Let's help you find a bitcoin wallet.

Answer the following questions to create a list of wallets that meet your
needs.

Skip helper Next

## Whatâs your operating system?

Change

### Mobile wallets

![android](/img/os/wallet_menu_android.svg)
![android](/img/os/wallet_menu_android_bright.svg)

![ios](/img/os/wallet_menu_mac.svg) ![ios](/img/os/wallet_menu_mac_bright.svg)

Portable and convenient; ideal when making transactions face-to-face

Designed to use QR codes to make quick and seamless transactions

App marketplaces can delist/remove wallet making it difficult to receive
future updates

Damage or loss of device can potentially lead to loss of funds

### Desktop wallets

![linux](/img/os/wallet_menu_linux.svg)
![linux](/img/os/wallet_menu_linux_bright.svg)

![mac](/img/os/wallet_menu_mac.svg) ![mac](/img/os/wallet_menu_mac_bright.svg)

![windows](/img/os/wallet_menu_windows.svg)
![windows](/img/os/wallet_menu_windows_bright.svg)

Environment enables users to have complete control over funds

Some desktop wallets offer hardware wallet support, or can operate as full
nodes

Difficult to utilize QR codes when making transactions

Susceptible to bitcoin-stealing malware/spyware/viruses

### Hardware wallets

![hardware](/img/os/wallet_menu_hardware.svg)
![hardware](/img/os/wallet_menu_hardware_bright.svg)

One of the most secure methods to store funds

Ideal for storing large amounts of bitcoin

Difficult to use while mobile; not designed for scanning QR codes

Loss of device without proper backup can make funds unrecoverable

##  Which criteria are important to you?

(Optional)

Change

Control

Note: This option is unavailable based on your previous selections.

Some wallets give you full control over your bitcoin. This means no third
party can freeze or take away your funds. You are still responsible, however,
for securing and backing up your wallet.

Validation

Note: This option is unavailable based on your previous selections.

Some wallets have the ability to operate as a full node. This means no trust
in a third party is required when processing transactions. Full nodes provide
a high level of security, but they require a large amount of memory.

Transparency

Note: This option is unavailable based on your previous selections.

Some wallets are open-source and can be built deterministically, a process of
compiling software which ensures the resulting code can be reproduced to help
ensure it hasn't been tampered with.

Environment

Note: This option is unavailable based on your previous selections.

Some wallets can be loaded on computers which are vulnerable to malware.
Securing your computer, using a strong passphrase, moving most of your funds
to cold store or enabling 2FA or multifactor authentication can help you
protect your bitcoin.

Privacy

Note: This option is unavailable based on your previous selections.

Some wallets make it harder to spy on your transactions by rotating addresses.
They do not disclose information to peers on the network. They can also
optionally let you setup and use Tor as a proxy to prevent others from
associating transactions with your IP address.

Fees

Note: This option is unavailable based on your previous selections.

Some wallets give you full control over setting the fee paid to the bitcoin
network before making a transaction, or modifying it afterward, to ensure that
your transactions are confirmed in a timely manner without paying more than
you have to.

Skip helper

Next

## What features are you looking for?

(Optional)

Change

2FA

Note: This option is unavailable based on your previous selections.

Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a way to add additional security to your
wallet. The first 'factor' is your password for your wallet. The second
'factor' is a verification code retrieved via text message or from an app on a
mobile device. 2FA is conceptually similar to a security token device that
banks in some countries require for online banking. It likely requires relying
on the availability of a third party to provide the service.

Bech32

Note: This option is unavailable based on your previous selections.

Bech32 is a special address format made possible by SegWit (see the feature
description for SegWit for more info). This address format is also known as
'bc1 addresses'. Some bitcoin wallets and services do not yet support sending
or receiving to Bech32 addresses.

Full Node

Note: This option is unavailable based on your previous selections.

Some wallets fully validate transactions and blocks. Almost all full nodes
help the network by accepting transactions and blocks from other full nodes,
validating those transactions and blocks, and then relaying them to further
full nodes.

Hardware Wallet

Note: This option is unavailable based on your previous selections.

Some wallets can pair and connect to a hardware wallet in addition to being
able to send to them. While sending to a hardware wallet is something most all
wallets can do, being able to pair with one is a unique feature. This feature
enables you to be able to send and receive directly to and from a hardware
wallet.

Legacy Addresses

Note: This option is unavailable based on your previous selections.

Most wallets have the ability to send and receive with legacy bitcoin
addresses. Legacy addresses start with 1 or 3 (as opposed to starting with
bc1). Without legacy address support, you may not be able to receive bitcoin
from older wallets or exchanges.

Lightning

Note: This option is unavailable based on your previous selections.

Some wallets support transactions on the Lightning Network. The Lightning
Network is new and somewhat experimental. It supports transferring bitcoin
without having to record each transaction on the blockchain, resulting in
faster transactions and lower fees.

Multisig

Note: This option is unavailable based on your previous selections.

Some wallets have the ability to require more than one key to authorize a
transaction. This can be used to divide responsibility and control over
multiple parties.

SegWit

Note: This option is unavailable based on your previous selections.

Some wallets support SegWit, which uses block chain space more efficiently.
This helps reduce fees paid by helping the Bitcoin network scale and sets the
foundation for second layer solutions such as the Lightning Network.
