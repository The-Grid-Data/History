Labs is excited to announce a new development partnership with Neon Stack to bring Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility to the Eclipse network. With this integration, Solidity developers can now seamlessly deploy Ethereum-native solidity dApps from their existing codebase to Eclipse.\n\n**What is Eclipse?**\n\nThe Eclipse network is Ethereum's fastest L2, powered by the Solana Virtual Machine. Eclipse combines the best pieces of the modular stack, utilizing Ethereum for settlement, the Solana Virtual Machine for execution, Celestia for data availability, and RISC Zero for proving. This novel architecture enables a high-performance L2, with access to Ethereum's liquidity, while maintaining the hard constraint of verifiability. Eclipse gives developers a general-purpose L2 capable of massive scale that can power the next generation of decentralized applications.\n\n**The Developer Interoperability Challenge**\n\nThe Eclipse network is built as an SVM L2, meaning it natively cannot support EVM-based dApps and can only support SVM-based dApps. With more than 13,000 dApps[ in the Ethereum ecosystem](https://app.artemis.xyz/chains) and thousands of EVM developers, there is a massive opportunity for cross-chain growth. At Eclipse Labs, we understand that developers wish to retain their EVM knowledge, tooling familiarity, and access to Ethereum liquidity and its users but also need speed and throughput to scale, as is seen in the high-performance environment on Solana.\n\n**Neon Stack and Eclipse: Empowering EVM Developers**\n\nThe solution is Neon Stack - a standardized development stack that makes it easy for SVM-based blockchain networks to gain EVM compatibility for smart contract developers - which will now be utilized on the Eclipse SVM L2. Neon Stack integrates Neon EVM smart contracts and Neon Proxy and is a battle-tested solution. It has been live on Solana mainnet since July 2023 and has successfully deployed many DeFi, gaming, DEXs, and other Ethereum-native Solidity dApps to Solana from their existing codebase with minimal reconfiguration.\n\n**Enabling a Better Developer and User Experience**\n\nWith Neon Stack, developers on Eclipse can continue to write smart contracts in familiar languages such as Solidity and Vyper, utilize well-known Ethereum tools, retain Ethereum RPC API compatibility, and build around Ethereum accounts, signatures, and token standards, all while accessing the performance of the SVM. Similarly, users will benefit from accessing EVM-based dApps they frequently interact with in a more performant execution environment.\n\nThis alliance marks a significant milestone in advancing blockchain interoperability and scalability while simplifying infra implementation for developers who wish to use SVM prowess on an Ethereum-native dApp. By combining the ability of SVM developers and EVM developers to build on Eclipse and retain their respective developer experiences, Eclipse is further strengthening the harmonization between Solana and Ethereum.\n\nThis collaboration between Neon Stack and Eclipse, with its unique design, will lead developers to build high-quality dApps that take advantage of the best of what the two major L1s—Ethereum and Solana—and their native ecosystems and virtual machines have to offer.\n\nIf you are interested in deploying your EVM-based dApp on Eclipse to benefit from performance improvements so your users can enjoy a cheaper and faster user experience, fill out this [form](https://forms.gle/99z8ZY5H4me9j4rY6) to contact us!\n\n**About Neon EVM:**\n\nNeon EVM is an Ethereum Virtual Machine on Solana that allows developers to scale Ethereum dApps using Solana as the settlement layer. It operates as a smart contract on Solana that accepts transaction requests via public RPC endpoints. It gives developers the power to deploy Ethereum dApps directly with minimal reconfiguration to the code while benefiting from Solana's technical advantages such as parallel processing.

We’re incredibly excited to bring the existing SVM’s power to more users, but we’re also dedicated to pushing forward ongoing R\u0026D around the SVM itself. We’re focused on ensuring that Eclipse’s development undeniably returns value back to all SVM chains, especially Solana.\n\nAs a precursor to future articles on our thinking around fee markets, this article will analyze Solana’s existing fee market and associated proposals to improve it. We frame these proposals alongside the primary theoretical goals for any Transaction Fee Mechanism (TFM), borrowing heavily from the work of [Tim Roughgarden](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.01340.pdf), [Maryam Bahrani, Pranav Garimidi](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.01686.pdf), [Hao Chung, Elaine Shi](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03151.pdf), and others. We’ll indicate core definitions throughout with **\\*\\***.\n\nIn general, a TFM determines:\n\n1. Which transactions are included in a given block,\n\n2. The fees a given transaction pays, and\n\n3. How (and to whom) the accumulated transaction fees are distributed.\n\nUltimately, this article aims to combine the wealth of Ethereum-centric TFM research with Solana’s innovative engineering.\n\n## Overview of Solana \u0026 Ethereum Current TFMs\n\n### Solana vs. Ethereum Basics\n\nWe’ll begin with an overview of Solana’s TFM and contrast it to Ethereum’s. This will better contextualize the relevant proposals so that we can work towards modifying and improving the TFM. For starters:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AHx7NKNzlpkjg22zYaqaU.png?height=648\u0026width=1258)\n\nSolana’s base fee is a fixed 5,000 lamports (0.000005 SOL) ***per signature,*** and most transactions have one signature. It does not account for a transaction's broader computational resources (as measured by CUs).\n\n\u003e *Solana Tx Base Fee  =  (5,000 Lamports)  x  (# of Signatures in Tx)*\n\nEthereum’s base fee mechanism differs in two main ways:\n\n* **Dynamic** - Ethereum’s base fee (as measured by gwei per unit of gas) floats based on trailing market demand.\n\n* **More granular charge per unit of computation** - Ethereum’s per transaction base fee is linear in the amount of gas consumed.\n\nSo Ethereum’s per transaction base fee is:\n\n\u003e *Ethereum Tx Base Fee = ([Prevailing gas price in gwei](https://etherscan.io/gastracker)) x (gas used in tx)*\n\nSolana users can also add optional [priority fees](https://www.helius.dev/blog/priority-fees-understanding-solanas-transaction-fee-mechanics) to improve their inclusion probability. Unlike the base fee, the priority fee is priced ***per CU requested*** for a transaction. Solana transactions can include the following [Compute Budget](https://solana.com/docs/core/runtime#compute-budget) [instructions](https://solana.com/docs/terminology#instruction):\n\n* `SetComputeUnitLimit` - Transactions can set a maximum amount of CUs that they are allowed to consume (with a max of 1.4M CUs per transaction). When executed, the transaction can use up to that requested CU limit. If no `SetComputeUnitLimit` instruction is provided, the transaction’s CU limit is calculated as (# of instructions in the transaction) x ([200k CUs](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/4293f11cf13fc1e83f1baa2ca3bb2f8ea8f9a000/program-runtime/src/compute_budget.rs#L13)).\n\n* `SetComputeUnitPrice` - # of [micro-lamports](https://solana.com/docs/terminology#lamport) per CU requested that the transaction offers to pay in its priority fee.\n\nPutting them together:\n\n\u003e *Tx Priority Fee = (Tx CU Limit)  x  (CU Price)*\n\nNote that this priority fee is paid against the full CUs requested (regardless of whether the transaction uses the total amount requested), unlike in Ethereum, where the fee is a function of how much gas the transaction actually uses.\n\n### Fee Burn vs. Validator Rewards\n\nWhile the incentive for validators to prioritize high-fee transactions sits *outside of consensus*, it’s enforced *in consensus* that both the base fee and priority fee are 50/50 burned/sent to the leader (current block producer) in Solana:\n\n* **Base Fee** — Mandatory for block inclusion. Transactions lacking the requisite base fee will be rejected.\n\n* **Priority Fee** — Not mandatory for block inclusion. Used to optionally prioritize transactions that want to increase their probability of fast inclusion.\n\nA user cannot avoid paying the base fee, but one can avoid the priority fee and signal their desire to be prioritized in another manner. We already see this in practice — [Jito-Solana](https://www.jito.wtf/validators/) auctions pay 100% (less a fee) to the leader out-of-band. [SIMD-0096](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents/blob/main/proposals/0096-reward-collected-priority-fee-in-entirety.md) offers a simple fix to this issue, rewarding 100% of the priority fee to the validator.\n\n![Direct Transfer](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3QKkq2Cp47CrFsznBNN8P.png?height=706\u0026width=1390)\n\nImportantly, Solana validators cast votes for each block with on-chain transactions. They pay the base fee for each of these transactions.\n\n[Solana has been generating its all-time highs for network fees lately](https://twitter.com/smyyguy/status/1753415253726015922/photo/2), driven by a sharp increase in priority fees. [Recent fee splits are shown below](https://solanacompass.com/statistics/fees):\n\n![Source: Solana Compass](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DGxNXOj1KnOrEst-WoWO9.png?height=802\u0026width=2256)\n\n### Ethereum Block Builder vs. Solana Scheduler\n\nEthereum’s block production is generally easier to understand, so we’ll start there. Nearly all validators (a.k.a. proposers) outsource block production to out-of-protocol builders via [MEV-Boost](https://boost.flashbots.net/). Builders create blocks every 12 seconds (Ethereum’s slot time) and pass these whole blocks to the proposer (via a relay), who selects the highest-value block.\n\nIn both Ethereum and Solana, block producers have the power to order transactions arbitrarily within a block. They are incentivized to do so in a manner that maximizes their profit. For example, different Ethereum builders can compete by running proprietary algorithms that more effectively maximize profits versus competitors.\n\nThis means that even in Ethereum, sending a high-priority fee *does not* achieve any in-protocol deterministic guarantee of block *inclusion* or *ordering*. However, it is very likely to achieve the expected result due to the nature of Ethereum’s current block-building process in which the builder builds a full profit-maximizing block at the end of each discrete slot.\n\nFor example, a searcher may send an arbitrage transaction with an incredibly high priority fee (e.g., higher than all other eligible transactions combined) to the builder, requesting its inclusion at the top of the block and to exclude the transaction from the block entirely if it doesn’t get the top of block position. In this case, a rational profit-maximizing builder will include this transaction at the top of the block even if they only received it right towards the end of their 12-second slot.\n\nYou’ll note that there are two different guarantees that fees are trying to achieve here:\n\n* **Inclusion** - A user wants to get their transaction included in this block, but they don’t care where it lands in the block.\n\n* **Ordering** - A user doesn’t just want to be included in the block anywhere; they want priority access to a specific state at a given time.\n\nEthereum’s [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559) mechanism has proven quite effective at enabling users to easily bid for block inclusion with a high probability of success. There’s a global reserve price that everyone knows to pay, and paying it (usually alongside a nominal priority fee) should reliably get a user’s transaction included promptly. However, the mechanism does not seek to provide any assurances around ordering (i.e., priority access to state), whereas out-of-protocol mechanisms are reliable for users seeking such assurances (directly from builders, for example).\n\nSolana’s block-building process works very differently. Validators do not outsource full block production in discrete time slots to out-of-protocol builders. The “[scheduler](https://docs.solana.com/proposals/fee_transaction_priority#scheduler-implementation)” is the default algorithm included in the [Solana Labs validator client](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana), which schedules transactions for execution and builds blocks continuously.\n\nAdditionally, [Solana transactions](https://solana.com/docs/core/transactions#overview-of-a-transaction) specify what accounts must be read- and write-locked for execution. This allows the scheduler to iteratively sort which transactions can be executed concurrently — as transactions that don’t touch the same state can be executed in parallel.\n\nWithin a block, a maximum of [12,000,000 CUs](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/2448486106f738c3bd66940babfbf1eb09a56d59/cost-model/src/block_cost_limits.rs) can be used for sequential writes to a single account (“piece of state”). This is roughly the amount of [CUs that can be processed by a single thread per 400ms slot](https://twitter.com/0xMert_/status/1720869858475208736?t=zCiKPg7-rFykZSS5daIYHw\u0026s=19) on reasonable node requirements. Solana’s per-block limit is then [48,000,000 CUs](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/2448486106f738c3bd66940babfbf1eb09a56d59/cost-model/src/block_cost_limits.rs). The current scheduler implementation uses four threads for non-vote transactions, and 12M x 4 = 48M. In theory, this means using more cores = increasing CU limits. Scaling with hardware.\n\nThe scheduler non-deterministically prioritizes transactions with higher priority fees. However, this generally provides less reliable prioritization guarantees than mechanisms such as those described in the case of Ethereum today.\n\nIn Solana, validators running the default scheduler build blocks *continuously*, so transactions can be added to an in-progress block and executed before waiting until the slot's end to organize them solely by priority fee. The intention is for the scheduler to *very roughly* profit-maximize by prioritizing transactions [based on their total CU price](https://x.com/apfitzge/status/1750280375258206482?s=20).\n\nSolana’s default multi-threaded scheduler also introduces additional “jitter.” Transactions are assigned randomly to one of the four threads, with each thread maintaining its own queue of transactions waiting for execution. Priority fees are then used to prioritize transactions intra-thread. However, they do not help prioritize transactions inter-thread.\n\nFor example, two searchers may each send a transaction simultaneously to capture the same arbitrage opportunity, and the one that sends a *lower* priority fee may even win because they land in a less clogged queue by chance. This reduces the efficacy of priority fees and increases the incentive to spam relative to Ethereum — especially since inclusion for transactions is also dependent on when, within a given slot, a transaction gets to the current block producer.\n\nNote that there are [planned changes](https://apfitzge.github.io/posts/solana-scheduler/) to Solana’s default scheduler, which aim to address some of the issues with the current implementation by relying on a graph of transaction dependencies and scheduling the highest priority unblocked (non-write-locked) transactions in the graph — we cover this later in the article.\n\nWhile mostly outside this article's scope, the [Jito-Solana client](https://jito-foundation.gitbook.io/mev/jito-solana/features) allows searchers to capture miner/maximal extractable value (MEV) more efficiently in ways that minimize negative externalities on Solana. Jito-Solana deviates from Solana’s default scheduler by introducing out-of-protocol discrete 200-millisecond [Flashbots-esque bundle auctions](https://4pillars.io/en/articles/jito-the-ruler-of-solana-mev/public), which are run in parallel to the default continuous block production and a private mempool (which again deviates from Solana’s default TFM). The adoption of the Jito-Solana client by Solana validators ([\\\u003e50% of validators run it today](https://jito.retool.com/embedded/public/3557dd68-f772-4f4f-8a7b-f479941dba02)) has helped tackle some of the issues with Solana’s existing TFM — namely, the prevalence of MEV-driven spam.\n\n## Shortcomings of Solana’s Current TFM\n\nWhile Solana’s TFM is highly promising, it also has some potential shortcomings for now:\n\n### Incentive to Spam\n\nAs mentioned above, transactions are ordered in somewhat of a first in, first out (FIFO) manner as soon as they reach the block producer. Additionally, they’re subject to non-determinism from both network jitter and the randomized thread allocation of the default scheduler. Although priority fees may help inclusion probability in certain circumstances, a substantial incentive still exists to spam transactions to maximize the fastest inclusion probability (e.g., a searcher racing to liquidate an in-default position on a lending market). The [image below from Jito Labs](https://www.jito.network/blog/solving-the-mev-problem-on-solana-a-guide-for-stakers/) helps demonstrate the suboptimal nature of spam transactions.\n\n![Source: Jito Foundation](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/o3NcWf_EzbAMGci6wSUY9.png?height=564\u0026width=1003)\n\n### First-Price Auction\n\nIn a naive first-price auction (FPA), users just submit bids, with the highest getting included in the block. One [issue with FPAs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjO-X_8TfZs\u0026list=PLEGCF-WLh2RLOHv_xUGLqRts_9JxrckiA\u0026index=58) is that they’re not very user-friendly. Users must guess what other users are bidding, thinking about what they’re willing to bid up to, potentially shading their bid lower so as not to overpay based on what they believe others are bidding, for example.\n\nMore formally, the FPA model is non-DSIC:\n\n\u003e **\\*\\*Dominant Strategy Incentive Compatible (DSIC)**: Assuming that the block producer implements the TFM honestly, then the prescribed bidding strategy should be the dominant strategy for users. This means users will bid (in transaction fees) at the exact value they ascribe to transaction inclusion [\\[Chu22\\]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03151.pdf).\n\nDSIC is one of the key properties that the creators of EIP-1559 aimed to introduce into Ethereum’s TFM with its implementation, and as we described earlier, it can be considered a success. Users more easily know the public reserve price to be included in the block at a given time (via the dynamic base fee), so paying it (plus any nominal priority fee) will almost always get your transaction included quickly.\n\nConversely, Solana’s TFM is a naive FPA. It lacks a reliable mechanism for users to accurately express their preference for block inclusion and is non-DSIC. In practice, trying to set exactly the right priority fee at the right time is incredibly challenging. [This disproportionately favors sophisticated participants](https://twitter.com/0xEdgar/status/1753215227867398216) who are more capable of bypassing network and scheduler jitter (e.g., via co-location or spamming transactions).\n\n### 50/50 Burn/Validator Payout\n\nAs noted earlier, Ethereum burns 100% of the base fee while sending 100% of the priority fee to the block producer, while for Solana, both the base fee and priority fee are 50/50 burned/paid to the block producer. As a result of this, the Solana TFM is non-OCA-proof:\n\n\u003e **\\*\\*Off-Chain Agreement-proofness (OCA-proofness or SCP)**: No off-chain agreement between users and the block producer can Pareto improve the outcome of the TFM for a given block [\\[Rou21\\]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.01340.pdf). A c-SCP protocol is resistant to a coalition of the block producer and up to *c* users being able to profit by deviating from reporting truthfully.\n\nWe see a clear example of this with Jito-Solana’s out-of-protocol auctions paying out 100% of bids (less Jito’s cut) to the block producers, rather than burning 50% — Jito-Solana is an example of an Off-Chain Agreement used by block producers. However, we note that Jito-Solana tips are not equivalent to priority fees, as the former are only paid if the associated transaction (and bundle) successfully executes.\n\nThe recently proposed [SIMD-0109](https://github.com/buffalu/solana-improvement-documents/blob/lb/simd_0108/proposals/0109-dynamic-tips.md) would introduce a tipping mechanism (similar to that used by Jito-Solana’s out-protocol-auction) into the protocol as a native instruction.\n\n### Lack of Privileged Transaction Types\n\nSolana vote transactions are posted on-chain and must be included in blocks, yet each validator must pay for the costs of said transactions. This represents a significant fixed cost (paid for privately by validators) despite the positive externality of the inclusion of vote transactions. This cost is exacerbated by the fact that vote transactions are overcharged relative to the CUs consumed (i.e., they use relatively few CUs vs. the average transaction). The economics create a centralizing effect here, as the total voting cost is roughly constant for any validator while the rewards earned are proportional to stake weight.\n\n![Source: Ceteris, Solana the Monolith](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BgZf4rg4AVMow8Im95tSM.webp?height=405\u0026width=720)\n\nAs an aside, similar logic could be extended to include reliable oracle updates, which networks typically charge for despite the positive externality of accurate on-chain price feeds. A more opinionated chain that derives high value from a particular robust oracle may choose to enshrine a mechanism that subsidizes its cost.\n\n### Solana’s Local Fee Market\n\nSolana’s approximation of a local fee mechanism exists because no account can write more than 12M CUs per 48M block limit. This, alongside the multi-threaded nature of Solana’s default scheduler, means that a maximum of 25% of transactions in a block can correspond to a single piece of in-demand state. In theory, users of less-in-demand state should not have to increase their priority fees for strong inclusion guarantees compared to users of in-demand state.\n\nThis is arguably not a genuine local fee mechanism. The mechanism is not enforced by consensus (it’s only at the scheduler level), and the relationship between priority fees and block inclusion is rather non-deterministic (as previously mentioned). It also lacks a notion of ‘elasticity’ where both target and maximum resource limits exist.\n\n### Inefficient CU Usage \u0026 Requests\n\nBecause Solana’s base fee does not account for CUs, it does not incentivize transactions to:\n\n* **Use CUs efficiently** — A transaction with 1.4M CUs carries the same base fee as one with 100k CUs, all else equal.\n\n* **Request CUs efficiently** — Even if a transaction uses 50k CUs, it carries the same base fee whether it requests 100k CUs or 1M CUs.\n\nThis can lead to an overestimation of compute needed within a given block by the scheduler and an efficiency loss compared to resources required by the block producer at a given slot. A DSIC TFM would fix this issue as a user’s dominant strategy would be that of the prescribed bidding strategy — in this case, accurately representing the expected usage of CUs.\n\n### Costless to Write Lock Accounts\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Solana transactions specify upfront all accounts they will read or write to while executing. However, this mechanism can be abused today to globally lock any account at effectively no cost. For example:\n\n* I send **$$Tx_{A}$$** which specifies that it will write to $$Account_{A}$$.\n\n* The leader receives $$Tx_{A}$$, schedules it, and starts to execute it. **$$Account_{A}$$** is now locked - no other transaction touching **$$Account_{A}$$** can be executed until **$$Tx_{A}$$** has finished executing.\n\nThe problem stems from the fact that anyone can send transactions that write-lock any accounts they want. There’s no cost to locking accounts, and transactions can even lock accounts that they don’t use, which is a clear spam attack vector. Moreover, account owners don’t have control over who can write-lock their own account.\n\n## TFM Proposals \u0026 Frameworks\n\nEvery blockchain must ultimately decide how to allocate the scarce resource of its finite blockspace among users, which it does via its TFM. Below, we will discuss several relevant TFM proposals and frameworks that may be valuable for Solana.\n\n### Multidimensional Blockchain Fee Markets\n\nMost existing fee markets are one-dimensional, built around a single fungible unit of account (e.g., gas in Ethereum). However, this single resource purchased is a proxy for many underlying non-fungible resources (e.g., bandwidth, computation, and storage).\n\nFor example, each [Ethereum opcode](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/evm/opcodes) carries a certain fixed amount of gas it consumes (e.g., ADD uses 3 gas, while MUL uses 5). The gas price for each opcode was set as a rough approximation of the underlying resources they use and how expensive those are deemed to be for nodes in the network. For example, this implicit measure of an operation's cost can be determined by running benchmarks on real-world hardware.\n\nHowever, it’s also possible to construct multidimensional fee markets that individually price these different non-fungible resources rather than combining them into one unit. [EIP-4844](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-4844.md) is a straightforward two-dimensional fee market, as data blobs have their own fee market independent of Ethereum execution gas.\n\n[This 2022 paper](https://angeris.github.io/papers/block-space.pdf) by Diamandis, Evans, Chitra, and Angeris analyzes how to construct multidimensional fee markets such as this. Their work frames the TFM construction problem from the perspective of a network designer aiming to maximize the welfare (or total utility) of the users of the blockchain minus the resource consumption of said users, subject to the chain’s transaction and block constraints (for example, smart contract limits or CU/gas limits). The main result of the paper is that despite the welfare being unknown, they design a mechanism that maximizes it and show how to explicitly construct said mechanism.\n\n\u003e **\\*\\*Welfare Maximizing**: The intended allocation and payment rules imply that the sum of consumer and miner surplus is (approximately) maximized.\n\nTheir key finding is that an equivalent TFM is implementable, which is one where the allocation rule is set such that the participants in the mechanism are incentized to act in accordance with the auction's intended behavior. This work demonstrates that pricing resources separately can make a blockchain more efficient and more resilient to periods of high congestion or spam. It is implemented in practice for both Avalanche and Penumbra. Controller-based base fee mechanisms, such as EIP-1559, are highlighted as a potential approach that could work exceptionally well on Solana and SVM chains, given the short block times, allowing the base fee to adjust quickly to changes in user demand and resource availability.\n\nAs previously mentioned, one conclusion from the paper is that it is possible to design systematic and computationally efficient ways to help define and update the pricing of multidimensional resources for blockchains. However, a natural question should be: what resources would make sense to price distinctly? Some practical work has been done within other blockchain contexts to make such decisions. For example, Penumbra has [implemented](https://x.com/penumbrazone/status/1711890802803409249?s=20) a form of multidimensional resource pricing to price resources used by full nodes and end-user devices separately on their privacy-centric blockchain.\n\nWhile the 2022 paper generally discusses multidimensional pricing of base resources (e.g., compute, bandwidth, storage), it is also possible to implement multidimensional resource pricing per account (i.e., per “piece of state”). Each account is treated as a different resource. This is discussed in [this recent article](https://www.umbraresearch.xyz/writings/toward-multidimensional-solana-fees), which builds on the original paper. Individually pricing accounts (rather than compute, storage, bandwidth, etc.) as the underlying resource may also be more straightforward to implement with a reduced risk of [resource exhaustion attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.07220).\n\n### Exponential Fee for Write Lock Accounts\n\nFollowing [Anatoly’s](https://twitter.com/aeyakovenko) recent post on [SVM Execution Economics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZX7Cg_XOeMfKtPwnoFVhQVg5uHhiGp2GrAbVLexGr3o/edit#heading=h.4lfnnzm9dcox), [Tao Zhu](https://github.com/tao-stones), in collaboration with Anatoly, proposed [SIMD-0110](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents/pull/110). Its primary motivation is to deter spam with economic back pressure (i.e., increasing fees in a targeted manner over time to reduce the incentive to spam), resulting in more efficient network resource utilization. Failed arbitrage transactions continue to fill up [roughly half (or more)](https://dune.com/scarn_eth/solana-tx-fail-rate?START_DATE_d3d7dd=2024-01-01+00:00:00\u0026END_DATE_d01c8c=2024-01-31+00:00:00) of Solana's blockspace because it’s rational and incredibly cheap to spam.\n\nThe proposal recommends tracking the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of each account's CU utilization per block to achieve this. The cost to write-lock an account would increase exponentially based on its respective trailing CU utilization, deterring spam. The core logic is similar to how [EIP-1559](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md) sets Ethereum’s global base fee as a function of gas usage in trailing blocks. However, this SIMD is far more granular in setting per-account local base fee markets.\n\nThe basic implementation idea for the account-based varying write-lock fee would be as follows:\n\n* Track each contentious account’s trailing EMA *compute-unit utilization* over the past 150 slots.\n\n* The maximum number of accounts that will be tracked is 2048, where only the most contentious accounts with the highest write-lock *cost rate* are tracked.\n\n* If an account’s EMA *compute-unit utilization* is \u003e50% of its max CU limit, its write-lock *cost rate* will increase by X%. If it’s \u003c50% of its limit, the *cost rate* will decrease by X%.\n\n* V0 recommends an initial write-lock cost rate of 1000 micro-lamports/CU and a *cost rate* adjustment rate of 1% per slot (note that the exact percentages here are all subject to change given the early nature of the proposal).\n\n* The write-lock fee for an account at a given block is calculated by multiplying the write-lock cost rate by the transaction’s requested CUs.\n\n* Transactions continue to pay signature fees, and optional priority fees also remain.\n\n* Collected write-lock fees are 100% burnt.\n\n* Collected priority fees are 100% rewarded.\n\n* Collected signature fees are 50% burnt and 50% rewarded.\n\nThis proposal would make the write-lock feature of Solana (usually) DSIC similar to how EIP-1559 made Ethereum’s TFM (usually) DSIC and MMIC [\\[Rou23\\]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.01340.pdf) — except in the presence of sudden fee spikes.\n\nWe can define the MMIC property as follows:\n\n\u003e **\\*\\*Myopic Miner Incentive Compatibility (MMIC)**: The block producer maximizes its utility by creating no fake transactions and following the stated rules of the TFM. Myopic means this goal only concerns the current block when judging utility maximization [\\[Rou21\\]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.01340.pdf).\n\nAny trailing mechanism is imperfect in that it may not accurately represent the exact current state of demand. For example, demand may be low for an extended period of time (and thus, the dynamic base fee is low), then spike suddenly for an NFT mint. This can be the case at a global level (as in Ethereum’s TFM) and may be even more volatile at a local per-account level (as is considered in SIMD-0110).\n\nHowever, Solana also benefits from its incredibly low block times here. These can allow the base fee to adjust more rapidly to a sudden demand shock, depending on how aggressively the curve is set to move. The shape of the fee controller here is incredibly important.\n\n[The fact that this write-lock fee is charged on CUs *requested* also properly incentivizes users and developers to accurately estimate a transaction’s CU usage](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents/pull/110/files#r1460668318). This avoids the issue we discussed earlier where the current flat signature base has no penalty for requesting far more CUs than required (even up to the max of 1.4mm CUs). Otherwise, only the priority fee carries this incentive today (as it is also charged by CUs requested).\n\nOne potential criticism here is that account-based local-fee markets (especially this proposal, which requires an ongoing EMA to be calculated for every account) could be computationally expensive. This type of multidimensional fee is unbounded, given that any account can be congested, which would likely present difficulties for such a TFM. However, in SIMD-0110’s case, this is avoided by setting an upper limit on the number of accounts whose CU usage EMA can be tracked at a given time.\n\n\u003e **\\*\\*Efficiently Computable**: The block auction mechanism must be designed such that it can be efficiently computed for a given block producer (or builder) — Eclipse and Solana’s slots are less than 400ms, which puts a tight constraint on maximum compute time for a given block.\n\nGiven that Solana block inclusion would still be non-deterministic even with this proposal implemented, there can still potentially be issues with users accurately updating their bids in real-time to ensure their transactions are included in blocks. Further addressing this requires changes to the scheduler as we discuss in the next section.\n\n### Changes to Solana’s Default Scheduler\n\nAs discussed earlier, the “[scheduler](https://docs.solana.com/proposals/fee_transaction_priority#scheduler-implementation)” is the default algorithm included in the [Solana Labs validator client](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana), which schedules transactions for execution and builds blocks continuously. It plays an incredibly important role in Solana’s fee market even though its default behavior is not enforced in-protocol as validators may choose to run other algorithms. We’ll focus here on the current scheduler and upcoming proposed changes, which are being worked on by [Andrew Fitzgerald](https://twitter.com/apfitzge).\n\nSolana’s current scheduler introduces “jitter” in its handling of users’ transactions by randomly assigning them to one of the four non-vote transaction threads (an additional two threads are reserved for processing vote transactions) before trying to sort the outstanding transactions by priority fee and check the relevant locks (‘lock grab’), as [the diagram below](https://apfitzge.github.io/posts/solana-scheduler/) shows. Multiple batches of transactions are pulled to be allocated to threads during the “Banking Stage” — the process run by a Solana validator wherein transactions are processed and under which the scheduling process occurs.\n\n![Source: Andrew Fitzgerald, Solana Banking Stage and Scheduler](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZeF9bxHqQNOj_i809tUuW.png?height=832\u0026width=994)\n\nOne significant issue with the default scheduler has been that during periods of intense network activity, the queue of each thread is often filled with conflicting transactions (say before an NFT mint or a widely anticipated token generation event). Each thread may contain transactions with the same or overlapping read- or write-locks, meaning those transactions must be rescheduled for later execution. The result of this, however, is that in the extreme worst case, only one of the four default scheduler threads could be executing transactions at a given time.\n\nThe crux of the upgrade to Solana’s default scheduler lies in the transition from the legacy approach (named the *ThreadLocalMultiIterator* mode) to the new approach to scheduling, named the *CentralScheduler* mode. This article will only provide an overview and analysis of the changes. However, further information can be found in Andrew Fitzgerald’s [article](https://apfitzge.github.io/posts/solana-scheduler/) and an accompanying [summary blogpost](https://medium.com/@harshpatel_36138/whats-new-with-solana-s-transaction-scheduler-bcf79a7d33f7) by Harsh Patel from the [Tiny Dancer](https://www.tinydancer.io/) team. An overview of the new scheduling process is shown below.\n\n![Source: Andrew Fitzgerald, Solana Banking Stage and Scheduler](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/v7RX7V68yYh5swlEpFssN.png?height=826\u0026width=1172)\n\nThe new scheduler involves a central single scheduler receiving transactions from the channel before checking for the relevant locks. After this point, transactions are assigned to particular parallel worker threads for execution. The central scheduler has a view of the various read- and write-locks used by a given worker thread, allowing it to determine the best thread for a new transaction. As transactions are executed and processed by a given worker thread, a message is sent back to the central scheduler so it can reevaluate which parts of Solana’s state are considered locked.\n\nThe scheduler uses an algorithm referred to as a “prio-graph,” which is a direct acrylic graph that begins with the highest priority (fee) transactions and lines (or, more accurately, edges) between a given highest priority transactions and the following highest priority transactions which conflict with it due to overlapping locks. This is (tentatively) done for a “look-ahead” window of a preconfigured size of 2,048 (subject to change) transactions, which can be added to the graph — the following charts show the prio-graph works for a given set of transactions where edges between them represent conflicting locks.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6LX5RKlkZX4mcr1wbFDkq.png?height=564\u0026width=1086)\n\nIn addition to adopting the prio-graph scheduler, this version introduces additional efficiencies to help reduce processing overhead, such as removing the redundant elements of the banking stage. The new scheduler should improve by significantly reducing the probability of failed writes and read-locking during periods of high activity on Solana. We could expect a reduction in jitter due to the new default scheduler. Still, given the continuous nature of the block-building process, there will continue to be non-determinism in block inclusion.\n\n### Program Rebatable Account Write (PRAW) Fees\n\nAuthored by [Godmode Galactus](https://twitter.com/godmodegalactus) and [Max Schneider](https://twitter.com/m_schneider), [SIMD-0016](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents/pull/16) proposes Program Rebatable Account Write (PRAW) fees. They would give significant control to application developers, as they could set the criteria for payment and rebates of these fees, allowing them to incentivize and disincentivize user behavior as they see fit.\n\nCurrently, Solana programs have no ability to penalize transactions for acquiring write locks over their state. PRAW fees would allow Solana account owners to charge for failed transactions that write-lock their state. These fees would be transferred to the writable account they are locking. However, account owners can set these fees such that they are then *rebated* back to the user at the end of the transaction if it meets the specified criteria.\n\nIn particular, this can deter users from write-locking accounts that they do not actually use in the transaction’s execution. This is currently possible given that Solana currently has no checks in place to see whether a given account would be used, a priori, by a given transaction that has write-locked it. PRAWs offer programs a way to disincentivize transactions that lock the program’s state in an attempt to identify an opportunity with the intention to revert if the opportunity is no longer valid at the time of execution. These fees would be applied even if the transaction were to fail during execution.\n\nConversely, users can specify the maximum amount of PRAW fees they are willing to pay in a transaction. Any fee specified in the transaction above that of the current PRAW fee for a given write-locked account would be refunded.\n\nMembers of the Solana community flagged issues with this proposal: the ability for different programs to operate entirely autonomously seems suboptimal, and the ability to estimate fees accurately would prove difficult. Moreover, there are potentially simpler and more uniform ways to deal with these griefing issues around write-locked accounts, such as SIMD-0110.\n\n\u003e **\\*\\*Griefing Resistance**: A subset of DSIC wherein users are not incentivized to misrepresent their access lists — misstating the resources required for their transaction \\[[Gar23](https://github.com/pgarimidi/Solana-Scheduler/blob/main/Solana_TFMs.pdf)\\].\n\nThe PRAW proposal would potentially fail to prevent spam as it relies on application developers sufficiently: 1) being able to distinguish spam from \"normal behavior\" and 2) voluntarily choosing to charge more for a negative externality they are partially responsible for when it may not be in their best interest to do so, and they can simply choose not to.\n\nIn contrast, while members of the Solana research community are undeniably split on the introduction of EMA base fees, there is generally agreement around adding some component of the base fee which scales with CUs. This can incentivize accurate CU estimation and efficient usage of CUs by developers.\n\n## Parting Thoughts\n\nSolana’s unique engineering and performance goals require unique TFM considerations. Simply porting Ethereum’s existing fee market to Solana is, of course, not the solution here, but there are valuable lessons to be learned from it. This is highly relevant for mechanisms that are both:\n\n* **In-protocol** - Consensus-enforced TFMs (e.g., [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559) and [SIMD-0110](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents/pull/110/files?short_path=9379e5d#diff-9379e5da836047dde1fc02c5fff29efb189d972c2b1a9de50f50af748db279aa))\n\n* **Out-of-protocol** - PBS via MEV-Boost, Solana scheduler improvements, and Jito auctions\n\nFor both Solana and Ethereum, in-protocol and out-of-protocol mechanisms appear likely to co-exist and evolve together going forward. The balance between them is one of the fundamental questions in designing these systems. The debate surrounding [SIMD-0110](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents/pull/110/files?short_path=9379e5d#diff-9379e5da836047dde1fc02c5fff29efb189d972c2b1a9de50f50af748db279aa) often centers around two opposing views:\n\n* [Scheduler and networking improvements](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents/pull/110/files#r1461049183) to reduce jitter will sufficiently address the problems described here, so major changes to the in-protocol TFM are unnecessary.\n\n* While out-of-protocol scheduler and networking improvements are necessary, they are [inherently insufficient](https://twitter.com/0xEdgar/status/1753215228890726506). In-protocol economic backpressure is required.\n\nMultidimensional resource pricing in some form is clearly valuable in both cases as well. Ethereum is starting to pursue such a TFM at the base resource level, with [EIP-4844](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-4844.md) splitting out blob data from the execution market. Conversely, Solana is pushing ahead with multidimensional resource pricing at the individual account level to pioneer “local fee markets”.\n\nThe TFM research here is cutting-edge, and researchers are constantly finding new and innovative ways to improve how fees work on Solana and other chains. We’re optimistic that the proposals discussed here will all continue to make Solana even more efficient, scalable, user-friendly, and economically sustainable.\n\nAs Eclipse approaches our mainnet launch, we're also excited to share more on how we’ll apply this existing work to our own TFM, which will certainly continue to evolve for years to come. We intend to experiment with and push forward mechanisms in this area. An essential benefit of the modular paradigm is that it allows for easier cross-pollination of research and engineering from different ecosystems. This rate of experimentation will now only continue to increase, benefiting everyone building here for the long term.\n\n*Please follow the instructions [here](https://mirror.xyz/eclipsemainnet.eth/g_kdlnrbVXTjCMxGChfMMH5ZQcFjwq0VEnRj8FzuO6w) to get involved with Eclipse Testnet.

The upcoming release of our monorepo will contain the canonical bridge smart contracts, relayers, and a Docker container to run a test network for local development.\n\n## An Overview of Our Canonical Bridge\n\nEclipse is composed of three layers:\n\n1. **Execution**: A fork of the Solana Labs client ([v1.17](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/wiki/v1.17-Release-Schedule)) for SVM transaction execution\n\n2. **Settlement**: Our canonical bridge defining Eclipse's fork-choice rule exists on Ethereum, where fraud proofs will also be submitted\n\n3. **Data Availability**: Eclipse publishes the data necessary to produce fraud proofs as data blobs on Celestia\n\nThe diagram below illustrates how these modules interact:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/T6gnD0I-ZakKCfkDN8p_b.png?height=12399\u0026width=20484)\n\nThe rest of this article will focus on Eclipse's Ethereum bridge, as shown in the diagram. [Blobstream](https://blog.celestia.org/introducing-blobstream/) will relay attestations signed by Celestia's validator set to certify to Ethereum that the data for a batch of Eclipse's slots was published correctly. This allows Eclipse's bridge to verify the data provided for fraud proofs against the signed data roots from Celestia. In the rest of this section, we will outline the processes by which:\n\n1. funds are deposited via our bridge,\n\n2. data blobs of batches of Eclipse's blocks are posted on Celestia,\n\n3. withdrawals via the bridge are handled, and\n\n4. fraud proofs are generated in worst-case scenarios.\n\n### Depositing via Eclipse's Native Ethereum Bridge\n\nThe flow when a user deposits onto Eclipse via the native Ethereum bridge is summarized as follows:\n\n* A user calls Eclipse's [Deposit Bridge contract](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x7C9e161ebe55000a3220F972058Fb83273653a6e) on Ethereum\n\n* From within Eclipse's SVM executor *\\[1\\]*, the relayer *\\[2\\]* observes the user's deposit and destination address\n\n* Next, the relayer calls the SVM bridge program, which is responsible for transferring a user's deposit to the applicable destination address\n\n* The relayer verifies the deposit transaction via a zk-light client (to be implemented)\n\n* Finally, the block containing the subsequent post-deposit transfer transaction is finalized and published via a Solana [Geyser Plugin](https://docs.solana.com/developing/plugins/geyser-plugins)\n\nThe diagram below shows the interactions between Ethereum, Celestia, and the SVM Executor during the deposit flow described above:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qYPL0xr50N3j4p204X0Fr.png?height=14330\u0026width=28481)\n\n### Publishing Eclipse's Slots to Celestia as Data Blobs\n\nThe flow for publishing batches of Eclipse's slots to Celestia as data blobs is summarized below:\n\n* The SVM executor publishes each Eclipse slot to the message queue via Geyser\n\n* The SVM executor posts batches of Eclipse's slots to Celestia as [data blobs](https://docs.celestia.org/developers/submit-data)\n\n* The Celestia validator set produces [commitments](https://docs.celestia.org/learn/how-celestia-works/transaction-lifecycle) to the data blobs submitted, which can be used to prove the inclusion of a transaction on Eclipse's chain against the data root\n\n* The data roots contained in every single Celestia block header are relayed to Eclipse's bridge contract on Ethereum via Blobstream\n\nThe diagram below from [Celestia](https://docs.celestia.org/learn/how-celestia-works/transaction-lifecycle) explains how the commitment of the data within a given Celestia block is stored in the block header:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SFHFhyFpWM08oy_gFPjTh.png?height=7885\u0026width=18706)\n\n### Withdrawing and Submitting Fraud Proofs to Eclipse's Ethereum Bridge\n\nSimilarly to other L2s that use fraud proofs (Arbitrum, Fuel, and many others), withdrawals from Eclipse require a challenge period during which verifiers can submit fraud proofs in the case of an invalid state transition:\n\n* At a regular cadence, the SVM executor posts a commitment to an epoch (a predetermined number of batches) of Eclipse's slots to Ethereum, along with collateral\n\n* Eclipse’s bridge contract conducts some basic checks to ensure that the data posted is well-formed (described in the Fraud Proof Design section)\n\n* If the submitted batch passes these basic checks, there is a predefined window during which verifiers can post fraud proofs in the case that the batch commitment implies an invalid state transition\n\n* If a verifier posts a successful fraud proof, they win the executor's collateral, the posted batch is rejected, and the canonical state of the Eclipse L2 is rolled back to the last valid batch commitment. Here, Eclipse's governance would have the ability to elect a new executor\n\n* If the challenge period elapses with no successful fraud proof, the executor recovers its collateral along with a reward\n\n* Consequently, the Eclipse bridge contract will now complete any withdrawal transactions that were included in the finalized batch\n\n## Fraud Proof Design\n\nIn this final section, we will detail Eclipse's fraud proof system design, inspired by [Anatoly Yakovenko](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents/pull/65/commits/def54ac702f62ad997e931307bc0bc442a2bc16c) and [John Adler](https://ethresear.ch/t/compact-fraud-proofs-for-utxo-chains-without-intermediate-state-serialization/5885). Generally, for any fraud proof, a verifier must:\n\n1. Identify a transaction containing an invalid state transition\n\n2. Provide the inputs to said transaction with the invalid state transition\n\n3. Demonstrate that re-executing said transaction with the given inputs results in an output that is not equal to what was committed on-chain\n\nIn Eclipse's case, (1) Celestia merklizes blobs of batches of blocks that Eclipse's SVM executor posts, allowing transaction inclusion proofs via Merkle witnesses. For (2), unlike EVM-based L2s, which post a Merkle root to the global state tree, for performance reasons Eclipse does not update a global state tree on a transaction-by-transaction basis, but we will explain how we ensure the correctness of inputs in more detail below. Finally, in the case of (3), Eclipse's verifier generates a zk-proof of the output(s) for a given transaction, unlike the [interactive verification game approach](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/interactive-fraud-proofs-arbitrums-secret-sauce-debc3b019418) common across EVM-based L2s.\n\nAll Eclipse transactions can be represented as taking a list of input accounts, executing a transaction, and producing a list of resultant output accounts:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VzFyjgHXKvbUQXBTMnB2u.png?height=130\u0026width=1648)\n\nThe critical observation for our fraud proof design is that for transaction execution, it is always the case that any S_InputAccount must have been the S_OutputAccount of some previous transaction. This allows us to reference the last transaction in the chain that produced a given input account instead of providing a Merkle witness to a global state tree. As a result of our design, we introduce additional fraud accusation types, such as a reference to the previous transaction not being valid or the input account already being \"spent\" by some later transaction. We describe this process in more detail below:\n\n### Transaction Inputs Posted to Celestia\n\n* Transaction data (posted by the sequencer)\n\n* Transaction data (posted by the SVM executor) which contains the following:\n\n  * Transaction count *\\[3\\]*\n\n  * Celestia [namespace location](https://celestia.org/glossary/namespaced-merkle-tree/) of the transaction data\n\n  * Account hash *\\[4\\]* for each input, with transaction count resulting in each\n\n  * List of [sysvars](https://docs.solana.com/terminology#sysvar) used and value of each, with transaction count resulting in each (if applicable) *\\[5\\]*\n\n  * Transaction output, if the transaction was successful; otherwise, an indicator that the transaction failed (either because it failed to parse or because it was unable to execute)\n\n### Batch Commitments Posted to The Ethereum Bridge\n\nIn addition, the batches of transaction data posted to Celestia have their commitments relayed to the Ethereum contract. The commitments consist of:\n\n* The Celestia namespace location of the transaction data of the last transaction included in the batch\n\n* The Celestia namespace location of the execution data *\\[6\\]* of all included transactions\n\n* A list of deposits, withdrawals, and overrides, each of which comes with the transaction count of the associated Eclipse transaction\n\n### Criteria for an Invalid Batch\n\nAs explained above, there are several ways a batch can be found to be incorrect:\n\n* One of the linked Celestia namespace locations is malformed or does not point to data of the required type\n\n* There is a transaction on Celestia with no associated execution data, which can be due to two reasons:\n\n  * The transaction, which was supposed to be the most recent in the batch, has no associated execution data.\n\n    * In such a case, a verifier verifies that this is the case and the Ethereum bridge contract checks that the latest entry in the execution data list does not correspond to the correct transaction data\n\n  * The execution data of a different transaction is missing\n\n    * A verifier posts the Celestia namespace location of the transaction data of the offending transaction and the previous and following transactions in the order that was successfully executed. Following this, the bridge contract checks that this transaction was skipped\n\n* There is a transaction whose execution data is incorrect, which could be caused by the following:\n\n  * The transaction count associated with an account hash or sysvar does not produce the claimed output.\n\n    * In this case, a verifier posts the Celestia namespace location of the execution data for the given transaction with the corresponding count, and the bridge contract checks that the given value is incorrect.\n\n  * The transaction count associated with an account hash or sysvar is outdated\n\n    * A verifier posts the Celestia namespace location of the execution data for a newer transaction, modifying the value in question, and the bridge contract checks that this is indeed newer.\n\n  * The transaction output is incorrect, or the transaction uses an input that is not listed:\n\n    * In this case, a zk-proof of the correct execution of the transaction or a zk-proof that the transaction uses an input that is not listed is needed. This can be obtained in two ways:\n\n      * A verifier posts the proof, or\n\n      * A verifier posts the index of the transaction claimed to be fraudulent, and the Eclipse bridge contract uses this to solicit a zk-proof from [RISC Zero's Bonsai](https://dev.risczero.com/api/bonsai/)\n\n  * There was a deposit from Ethereum more than N batches ago, but there is no corresponding deposit in the transaction list (included in the batch commitment posted to the bridge contract) for the N past batches. Alternatively, there is a deposit in the transaction list with no related Ethereum deposit transaction, or the transaction exists but has already been included in another Eclipse batch\n\n    * The bridge contract in all of these cases can determine that this has happened and regard such a batch as invalid\n\n  * There is a deposit or withdrawal executed with no corresponding entry in the transaction list\n\n    * In such a case, a verifier posts the Celestia namespace location of the given execution data, and the bridge contract checks this fact to judge the transaction as invalid\n\n  * There is a deposit or withdrawal in the transaction list whose associated Eclipse transaction is not performing the expected action or whose transaction count is not within its expected transaction count range. In such a case, either one of the following would happen:\n\n    * The bridge would automatically determine this is the case and refuse the corresponding batch\n\n    * A verifier notices the invalid state transition and posts proof of the offending transaction, which is then verified by the bridge contract\n\nIf any commitment batch is found to be incorrect, the Eclipse bridge contract will roll back the bridge to that of the last provably correct batch commitment. Note that transactions are never removed from the chain, even in the case of fraud, so only the commitment needs to be re-computed.\n\n## Parting Thoughts\n\nThis article aimed to give a high-level guide to Eclipse's trust-minimized bridge on Ethereum and explain some details about our fraud proof design. Given the modular nature of our L2 and the nascence of our technology stack, we will continue to release articles and documentation about various aspects of Eclipse in the coming weeks.\n\nTo get involved with Eclipse Testnet, please follow our instructions [here](https://mirror.xyz/eclipsemainnet.eth/g_kdlnrbVXTjCMxGChfMMH5ZQcFjwq0VEnRj8FzuO6w). You can contact us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/EclipseFND) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/eclipse-labs) with specific inquiries about our Testnet, bridge, or technical questions.\n\n## Footnotes\n\n*\\[1\\]: The node which computes the results of SVM transactions and applies the eventual output to Eclipse’s new state*\n\n*\\[2\\]: An operator which passes on-chain events between Ethereum and Eclipse*\n\n*\\[3\\]: Note that the executor, not the sequencer, posts this. If it were included in the data posted by the sequencer, it would add the complication that the sequencer could skip over a count, making it impossible for the executor to do their job correctly. This could be compensated for in the fraud proof design, but it would add extra complexity. A second advantage of having only the executor post the count is that it makes it easy to allow transaction overrides to be posted to Celestia, if desired.*\n\n*\\[4\\]: SVM accounts can be represented with a unique hash. The only way this hash is modified is via a transaction.*\n\n*\\[5\\]: To do this without an excessive amount of hashing, we will run a trace on each executed program to see which parts of each used sysvar are actually accessed. This is possible, but will require modifying Solana's BPF interpreter.*\n\n*\\[6\\]: This includes data for attempted transactions that failed to execute.*","digest":"0Q9NufkOPaRfCwi0yFj-_D4eONgscqpr00HGgYCwkHA","title":"Exploring Eclipse's Canonical Ethereum Bridge and Proving System","publishedAtTimestamp":1704386768,"writingNFT":{"__ref":"WritingNFTType:Eay3H_a8W4Az6Bht_QEZ3GCQJjVJU2EuPM26O76_XSU"},"collectorBubbles":[{"__typename":"WritingNFTCollectorType","_id":"140","address":"0xF579fD7aeF3Adbb0B403AFA9D82Ece24d0aAADD3","project":{"__ref":"ProjectType:0xF579fD7aeF3Adbb0B403AFA9D82Ece24d0aAADD3"}},{"__typename":"WritingNFTCollectorType","_id":"143","address":"0x24b2532a347d1dC8dB3F1eA81763b4a2404dce4F","project":{"__ref":"ProjectType:0x24b2532a347d1dC8dB3F1eA81763b4a2404dce4F"}},{"__typename":"WritingNFTCollectorType","_id":"138","address":"0xf7A5bDBBC2579a2f4523C17B2ce18C9E6896d435","project":{"__ref":"ProjectType:0xf7A5bDBBC2579a2f4523C17B2ce18C9E6896d435"}}],"featuredImage":{"__typename":"MediaAssetType","mimetype":"image/png","url":"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IwToymyV79HTvQKwuCIL_.png?height=1280\u0026width=2560"},"publisher":{"__typename":"PublisherType","project":{"__ref":"ProjectType:0xe415Bc8724C2003e934F44A9165eF2dECCB6B8C5"},"member":{"__ref":"ProjectType:0xe415Bc8724C2003e934F44A9165eF2dECCB6B8C5"}},"settings":{"__typename":"EntrySettingsType","description":"","metaImage":{"__ref":"MediaAssetType:757398"},"title":""}},"WritingNFTType:b4DS68bR2RscR4PwkKccGaYvP8kH9Jbbnh-B7O9YdvU":{"__typename":"WritingNFTType","_id":"b4DS68bR2RscR4PwkKccGaYvP8kH9Jbbnh-B7O9YdvU","optimisticNumSold":408,"proxyAddress":"0x6fdE186E9ee2c3B32dc872Cb74D107d8EB8BF62d","purchases":{"__typename":"WritingNFTPurchaseType","numSold":408}},"ProjectType:0xfbFbc2ED58848f0870e0b522ddc01FF3695c8D3b":{"__typename":"ProjectType","_id":"0xfbFbc2ED58848f0870e0b522ddc01FF3695c8D3b","address":"0xfbFbc2ED58848f0870e0b522ddc01FF3695c8D3b","avatarURL":"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ediPq1rTHga79DQTqufYZ.jpeg?height=1000\u0026width=1000","description":"Just Poning around!","displayName":"Pone","domain":null,"ens":null,"gaTrackingID":null,"ga4TrackingID":null,"mailingListURL":null,"twitterUsername":null,"wnftChainId":10,"externalUrl":null,"headerImage":null,"theme":{"__typename":"UserProfileThemeType","accent":"BLUE","colorMode":"LIGHT"}},"entry:880611":{"__typename":"entry","_id":"g_kdlnrbVXTjCMxGChfMMH5ZQcFjwq0VEnRj8FzuO6w","id":880611,"body":"*Ethereum’s fastest Layer 2 just got closer.*\n\nWe’re excited to announce the next step toward the mass adoption of the Solana Virtual Machine: Eclipse, the first SVM Ethereum L2, is now live on Ethereum's Sepolia testnet and Celestia's Mocha testnet.\n\nThis marks our final milestone on the path to deploying [Eclipse Mainnet](https://mirror.xyz/eclipsemainnet.eth/me7bXLWJDS177V6nl8j1uzF1mxpX6nbGOLNeyBAwXgs), which will feature the best parts of the modular stack: Ethereum for settlement, Celestia for data availability, and the SVM for execution.\n\n## How can I use Eclipse Testnet?\n\nDevelopers can now bridge Sepolia ETH and deploy contracts to the final testnet before Eclipse Mainnet. To use the validating bridge, developers can refer to our [docs](https://docs.eclipse.builders/building-on-eclipse/bridging). The steps are roughly as follows:\n\n1. Create a keypair on Eclipse Testnet\n\n2. Receive Sepolia ETH using any available faucet\n\n3. Use the validating bridge to transfer tokens on Eclipse Testnet to your address\n\n4. Deploy contracts and interact with Eclipse Testnet apps\n\nThe first 1000 developers to deploy to Eclipse Testnet will receive a commemorative NFT on Eclipse Mainnet, launching early next year.\n\nOur validating bridge is currently undergoing an audit. Upon its completion, Eclipse will open a bug bounty program for the bridge contracts.\n\n## What has been built for Eclipse Testnet?\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6EeC2vZ2P-oAhgFbiP4dA.png?height=900\u0026width=1600)\n\nCompared to Eclipse Devnet, Eclipse Testnet additionally [publishes transactions](https://testnet.mintscan.io/celestia-testnet/account/celestia1rh9z568fqpm9hv2nv02sm2rusq8q9np3yc9qum) to Celestia’s Mocha testnet. This makes it possible for any full node to follow along and ensure the commitments posted to the validating bridge are correct.\n\nEclipse Testnet features the first deployment of Eclipse's validating bridge. When bridge transactions hit the Ethereum mailbox, [Firehose](https://github.com/streamingfast/firehose-ethereum) streams transactions to the full node running Eclipse for execution.\n\nWithdrawals from the Eclipse validating bridge are disabled, and there is no user interface for the bridge.

This includes work around novel fee markets that more accurately price compute, storage, and account locking. We'll also explore offering alternative bytecodes and custom gas tokens to give developers and users more options.\n\nWe welcome all community members to [join our Discord](http://discord.gg/eclipse-labs) to chat with the team and provide any testnet feedback.","digest":"g_kdlnrbVXTjCMxGChfMMH5ZQcFjwq0VEnRj8FzuO6w","title":"Eclipse Testnet Is Live","publishedAtTimestamp":1702482908,"writingNFT":{"__ref":"WritingNFTType:b4DS68bR2RscR4PwkKccGaYvP8kH9Jbbnh-B7O9YdvU"},"collectorBubbles":[{"__typename":"WritingNFTCollectorType","_id":"401","address":"0x817A322D652Ad609986c56EeBD3375fb9F0462A2","project":{"__ref":"ProjectType:0x817A322D652Ad609986c56EeBD3375fb9F0462A2"}},{"__typename":"WritingNFTCollectorType","_id":"406","address":"0xF579fD7aeF3Adbb0B403AFA9D82Ece24d0aAADD3","project":{"__ref":"ProjectType:0xF579fD7aeF3Adbb0B403AFA9D82Ece24d0aAADD3"}},{"__typename":"WritingNFTCollectorType","_id":"400","address":"0xfbFbc2ED58848f0870e0b522ddc01FF3695c8D3b","project":{"__ref":"ProjectType:0xfbFbc2ED58848f0870e0b522ddc01FF3695c8D3b"}}],"featuredImage":{"__typename":"MediaAssetType","mimetype":"image/png","url":"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tsNtJZjm7QEajxkbAbMyQ.png?height=640\u0026width=1280"},"publisher":{"__typename":"PublisherType","project":{"__ref":"ProjectType:0xe415Bc8724C2003e934F44A9165eF2dECCB6B8C5"},"member":{"__ref":"ProjectType:0xe415Bc8724C2003e934F44A9165eF2dECCB6B8C5"}},"settings":{"__typename":"EntrySettingsType","description":"","metaImage":null,"title":""}},"WritingNFTType:V0_RY9xRdF2WqCETDVyabKQTwnPHi9t7hvRIs8PDMVM":{"__typename":"WritingNFTType","_id":"V0_RY9xRdF2WqCETDVyabKQTwnPHi9t7hvRIs8PDMVM","optimisticNumSold":561,"proxyAddress":"0x4eE3280818f21D996e41b465775EAaa736ec2F87","purchases":{"__typename":"WritingNFTPurchaseType","numSold":561}},"MediaAssetType:463629":{"__typename":"MediaAssetType","id":463629,"cid":null,"mimetype":"image/jpeg","sizes":{"__typename":"MediaAssetSizesType","og":{"__typename":"MediaAssetSizeType","src":"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zVEsJrXaj4nRyT7dh_yH5.jpg?height=1080\u0026width=1920","height":1080,"width":1920},"lg":null,"md":null,"sm":null},"url":"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zVEsJrXaj4nRyT7dh_yH5.jpg?height=1080\u0026width=1920"},"ProjectType:0xF55a6bBe2971c636605eE369fb9374e2EEB9Fb71":{"__typename":"ProjectType","_id":"0xF55a6bBe2971c636605eE369fb9374e2EEB9Fb71","address":"0xF55a6bBe2971c636605eE369fb9374e2EEB9Fb71","avatarURL":"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VckTwm1RjJfUj1jEGX3Yd.jpg?height=640\u0026width=640","description":"","displayName":"Nust","domain":null,"ens":"nustt.eth","gaTrackingID":"","ga4TrackingID":"","mailingListURL":null,"twitterUsername":null,"wnftChainId":10,"externalUrl":null,"headerImage":{"__ref":"MediaAssetType:463629"},"theme":{"__typename":"UserProfileThemeType","accent":"BLUE","colorMode":"DARK"}},"ProjectType:0x67822171e30b633DB56fBf556051aa66b9221d79":{"__typename":"ProjectType","_id":"0x67822171e30b633DB56fBf556051aa66b9221d79","address":"0x67822171e30b633DB56fBf556051aa66b9221d79","avatarURL":"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RAeDiFDPce31tKqG_jV47.jpg?height=108\u0026width=108","description":"","displayName":"AVARAS","domain":null,"ens":null,"gaTrackingID":null,"ga4TrackingID":null,"mailingListURL":null,"twitterUsername":"avaras34","wnftChainId":10,"externalUrl":null,"headerImage":null,"theme":{"__typename":"UserProfileThemeType","accent":"BLUE","colorMode":"LIGHT"}},"ProjectType:0x21a8Be8B08672bcABc39d9bF368E9eDF4280CaA5":{"__typename":"ProjectType","_id":"0x21a8Be8B08672bcABc39d9bF368E9eDF4280CaA5","address":"0x21a8Be8B08672bcABc39d9bF368E9eDF4280CaA5","avatarURL":"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/i-oJ5q4HduuoNBSo5rt-0.webp?height=595\u0026width=1080","description":"看了两块快乐你快乐呢","displayName":"cao cao","domain":null,"ens":"cryptoagi.eth","gaTrackingID":"好看还不结婚吧结婚吧","ga4TrackingID":null,"mailingListURL":null,"twitterUsername":null,"wnftChainId":10,"externalUrl":null,"headerImage":null,"theme":{"__typename":"UserProfileThemeType","accent":"ORANGE","colorMode":"LIGHT"}},"entry:797082":{"__typename":"entry","_id":"me7bXLWJDS177V6nl8j1uzF1mxpX6nbGOLNeyBAwXgs","id":797082,"body":"*TL;DR: We’re excited to finally announce the architecture for Eclipse Mainnet: **Ethereum’s fastest L2, powered by the SVM**.*\n\nEclipse Mainnet is a general-purpose L2 that combines the best pieces of the modular stack:\n\n* **Settlement: Ethereum** - Eclipse will settle to Ethereum (i.e., the enshrined validating bridge will be on Ethereum) and use ETH as its gas token.\n\n* **Execution: Solana Virtual Machine (SVM)** - Eclipse will run the highly performant SVM as its execution environment.\n\n* **Data Availability: Celestia** - Eclipse will post its data to Celestia for scalable data availability (DA).\n\n* **Proving: RISC Zero** - Eclipse will use RISC Zero for ZK proofs of fraud (without intermediate state serialization!)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pYo4iLTzFHsImvKHwizsU.png?height=1866\u0026width=4898)\n\nMost of Eclipse’s headlines have been around our work to deploy app-specific rollups for a range of projects, but it’s now clearer than ever that Ethereum needs a general-purpose L2 capable of truly massive scale. Most applications don’t benefit from app-specific chain customizations, and the resulting isolation and complexity can actually result in worse UX and developer experience.\n\n[There’s often a false dichotomy presented](https://twitter.com/KyleSamani/status/1649236291806978048?s=20) between the modular rollup vision vs. the ability to have a single chain with massive scale, parallelized execution, and shared state. [“Modular” is often conflated with “app-specific”](https://x.com/jon_charb/status/1701730501134876758?s=20), which would lead you to believe that rollups mean a world of many fragmented and low-throughput chains. We challenge that idea.\n\n# Execution: Solana’s Speed \u0026 Scale\n\nEclipse Mainnet will adopt Solana’s best-in-class execution environment. This brings tremendous advantages:\n\n**Optimized Parallel Execution**\n\nThe SVM and its Sealevel runtime famously enable parallel transaction execution. Transactions which don’t touch overlapping state can be executed in parallel rather than sequentially.\n\nThis allows the SVM to directly scale with hardware as processors continue to add more cores at lower cost. [Single-threaded runtimes (such as today’s EVM) fundamentally do not benefit from reducing the cost per core](https://x.com/aeyakovenko/status/1686916794962079744?s=20). For over a decade now, single-threaded performance speedups have been continually diminishing. Nearly all improvements continue to come from increasing the number of cores, so it’s critical to take advantage of [this trend](https://github.com/karlrupp/microprocessor-trend-data) [by parallelizing workloads](https://www.karlrupp.net/2018/02/42-years-of-microprocessor-trend-data/):\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lFwm1FhfFlf1p2Zc6R9DN.png?height=1020\u0026width=1600)\n\nThere are some very early unproven attempts to [parallelize the EVM](https://writings.flashbots.net/speeding-up-evm-part-1), but adding this on while maintaining compatibility brings fundamental tradeoffs including suboptimal performance without addressing other bottlenecks (e.g., state growth). Contracts declaring state dependencies upfront (as in the SVM) allows for optimal parallelization.\n\n**Local Fee Markets**\n\nMost fee markets today are global, meaning that one hot application increases fees for *all* users of the chain. [One NFT mint shouldn’t render the chain useless for everything else](https://x.com/yugalabs/status/1520612362986078208?s=20). Solana’s amazing work on [local fee markets](https://twitter.com/solana/status/1615571640372580352?lang=en) [solves](https://x.com/time_composer/status/1649776724777762817?s=20) this cross-app state contention. In its current implementation, the scheduler prioritizes transactions without conflicts, allowing conflict-free transactions to go through with lower fees. Longer term, local fee markets will be implemented at a protocol level. This ensures that fee spikes for a single app don't impact the rest of the chain.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TSjT3fng-FVEQKI1K48pO.png?height=4578\u0026width=8636)\n\nLocal fee markets are possible thanks to Solana’s uniquely parallelized runtime. Trying to implement local fee markets for state hotspots in the EVM using heuristics (i.e., without declaring state access upfront) would present inefficiencies and likely attack vectors.\n\nThere’s also [early research underway](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents/pull/16) that would allow applications to easily internalize the local value attributable to them, which today generally requires [more creative app-level design](https://blog.uniswap.org/uniswap-v4).\n\n**State Growth Management**\n\nBefore the EVM even bumps up against sequential execution as a bottleneck, state growth is its far more pressing bottleneck.\n\nBecause there is no Merkle tree for state, Solana doesn't incur the overhead of updating a Merkle tree for each state update. Instead, after each epoch (\\~2.5 days), the entire state is merklized. This is much [cheaper than real-time merklization](https://x.com/toghrulmaharram/status/1699466187166335176?s=20) (as in the EVM).\n\nMore importantly, the EVM has [dynamic account access](https://x.com/aeyakovenko/status/1699465524231692384?s=20) (i.e., transactions can touch any state on-demand). That dynamic state lookup means that state cannot be loaded into memory prior to execution. In the SVM, each transaction specifies all the state that’s needed for execution.\n\nAs a result, [state size doesn't impact SVM execution](https://x.com/aeyakovenko/status/1699460999697555512?s=20). The network could safely double the snapshot size every 2 years without running into major issues assuming validators upgrade their storage disks every 2 years.\n\nFurthermore, teams like [Helius](https://www.helius.dev/) are actively improving the accessibility of historical data and reducing state size with [compression](https://docs.helius.dev/compression-and-das-api/what-is-compression-on-solana).\n\n**EVM Compatibility**\n\n[Neon EVM](https://neonevm.org/) is an EVM operating as a smart contract that can be deployed on any SVM chain. This brings full [EVM compatibility to Eclipse Mainnet](https://www.eclipse.builders/blog/neon-evm-and-eclipses-hybrid) (including EVM bytecode support and the Ethereum JSON-RPC) with [greater throughput than single-threaded EVMs](https://twitter.com/aeyakovenko/status/1689745762077523968?s=20). Because each Neon EVM instance has its own local fee market, apps can just deploy their own contract to attain the benefits of an app chain without fragmenting UX, security, or liquidity.\n\nSeparately, the [Solang](https://github.com/hyperledger/solang) compiler enables compilation of Solidity smart contracts code into SVM bytecode.\n\n**MetaMask Snaps**\n\nOnboarding EVM users to non-EVM chains has historically been a major hurdle, but the recently unveiled [Metamask Snaps](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/09/12/ethereum-developer-consensys-unveils-snaps-add-ons-for-metamask-browser/) are set to break down that barrier. EVM users can continue to use [MetaMask](https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/solflare-wallet/solana-snap/) without needing to switch wallets. The UX is comparable to interacting with any EVM chain, thanks to [Drift](https://www.drift.trade/)’s open-source contributions building out a great MetaMask Snap implementation. Eclipse Mainnet users will be able to interact with apps natively in MetaMask or use a Solana-native wallet like [Salmon](https://salmonwallet.io/).\n\n[Here’s a sneak peek of the UX from Drift](https://x.com/DriftProtocol/status/1700135022454276414?s=20):\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/M4b2vQJT03V-6eD7iUKMS.gif?height=720\u0026width=1280)\n\n**Firedancer**\n\n[Firedancer](https://jumpcrypto.com/firedancer/) is the highly anticipated Solana client being developed by Jump to drastically increase the network’s throughput, resilience, and efficiency. At launch we will stick as closely as possible to the Solana core client, but we plan to adopt Firedancer once the code is live and stable.\n\n**Safety**\n\nSolana’s runtime has a greatly reduced attack surface area which prevents the [infamous reentrancy exploits](https://blog.chain.link/reentrancy-attacks-and-the-dao-hack/) we’ve seen far too often. Specifically, the Solana runtime only allows programs to self-recurse, rather than allowing arbitrary reentrant cross program invocations. Moreover, separating state and code results in stateless code, which is typically easier to test effectively.\n\n**Easier Proving**\n\nThe SVM is register-based and has a much smaller instruction set vs. the EVM, making SVM execution easier to prove in ZK. For optimistic rollups, the register-based design allows for easier checkpointing.\n\n# Settlement: Ethereum’s Security \u0026 Liquidity\n\nAs with today’s major rollups, Eclipse Mainnet will settle to Ethereum. Concretely, this means that our validating bridge on Ethereum will be directly enshrined into Eclipse. Eclipse nodes will look to this bridge to determine the “canonical chain”. The bridge enforces the correct ordering for Eclipse.\n\nThis allows our users to gain certain security properties from Ethereum. The bridge will validate all Eclipse transactions, preventing submission of invalid states. Additionally, it will enforce eventual liveness and censorship resistance under certain failure cases. Even if the sequencer were to go down or start censoring at the L2, users would be able to force inclusion of their transactions via the bridge.\n\nBecause of these security properties, validiums and [optimiums](https://twitter.com/l2beat/status/1695045217080975782?s=20) are often referred to as “Ethereum L2s.” [L2BEAT defines](https://l2beat.com/scaling/summary) an L2 as “a chain that fully or partially derives its security from layer one Ethereum so that users do not have to rely on the honesty of L2 validators for the security of their funds.”\n\nEthereum settlement recognizes the importance that Ethereum-native assets will likely play in Eclipse Mainnet’s DeFi and NFT economies. ETH is the best decentralized money that most users clearly prefer, so we will also use ETH as our gas token. Longer term, fee abstraction will enable users to pay in any token of their choosing (e.g., USDC). There are no plans for Eclipse Mainnet to have its own token at this time.\n\n# Data Availability: Celestia’s Bandwidth \u0026 Verifiability\n\nEclipse Mainnet will utilize Celestia for data availability (a.k.a. [data publishing](https://x.com/dankrad/status/1699598362851287459?s=20) or [data publication](https://x.com/musalbas/status/1696521530409394253?s=20)). Celestia has been a long-standing ecosystem partner of Eclipse.\n\nEclipse Mainnet’s target throughput and fees are unfortunately not supported by Ethereum’s current bandwidth. This will remain so even after [EIP-4844](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844) (a.k.a. “Proto-danksharding”), which provides an average of \\~0.375 MB [blobspace](https://domothy.com/blobspace/) per block (with a limit of \\~0.75 MB per block).\n\n* For ERC-20 transfers with basic compression ([\\~154 bytes per transaction](https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/1554983955182809088)), this translates to \\~213 TPS across all rollups combined.\n\n* For swaps with compression [(\\~400 bytes per transaction)](https://x.com/gluk64/status/1693716324042621241?s=20), this translates to \\~82 TPS across all rollups combined.\n\nIn comparison, Celestia will launch with 2 MB blocks later this year. Blobspace is expected to increase to 8 MB shortly after launch, once enough [data availability sampling (DAS)](https://celestia.org/glossary/data-availability-sampling/) light nodes come online and the network proves stable. DAS light nodes serve two critical functions:\n\n* Enable users to verify for themselves that Eclipse block data has been made available\n\n* Contribute to securely scaling the entire network, as DA layers can safely increase their throughput as more DAS light nodes come online\n\nCelestia is expected to be the first DA layer to launch with DAS in production. This contrasts with traditional Data Availability Committees (DACs), which reintroduce committee [honesty assumptions without user verification](https://x.com/donnoh_eth/status/1699911540051173858?s=20) (akin to existing monolithic blockchains).\n\nThere’s an [inherent security assumption](https://x.com/sreeramkannan/status/1517420373163323392?s=20) for users who bridge their funds from Ethereum Mainnet to any chain that uses offchain DA. In particular, it is technically possible for Celestia validators to withhold transaction data but claim to the Ethereum bridge that the data is available. In practice, Celestia’s proof-of-stake consensus means data withholding on Celestia itself is slashable, making this risk unrealistic in our view.\n\nOverall, Celestia’s DAS light node support from day one, crypto-economic security properties, and highly scalable DA throughput make it the clear choice for Eclipse Mainnet today.\n\nNote that [some view onchain Ethereum DA as a requirement to be a true \"L2\" here](https://x.com/dankrad/status/1689634128101310464?s=20) for the reasons described above. We’re going by the more common L2 terminology cited earlier, and we want to be clear on the security considerations.\n\nWe also intend to monitor Ethereum’s progress on DA scaling after EIP-4844. [Exciting new research continues to come out](https://x.com/dannyryan/status/1698733448175727072?s=20), potentially offering high throughput DA sooner than previous ideas (which use more advanced distributed hash tables). If Ethereum offers greater scale for Eclipse to the benefit of our users, we would assess the possibility of migrating to Ethereum DA.\n\n# Proving: RISC Zero ZK Proofs of Fraud (Without Intermediate State Serialization!)\n\nOur proving will look similar to Anatoly’s [SVM fraud proofs SIMD](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents/pull/65), which is itself similar to John Adler's insight that state serialization is [expensive, and it is possible to avoid it](https://ethresear.ch/t/compact-fraud-proofs-for-utxo-chains-without-intermediate-state-serialization/5885).\n\nSpecifically, we want to avoid reintroducing a Merkle tree into the SVM. We experimented with inserting a Sparse Merkle Tree into the SVM early on, but updating the Merkle tree after each transaction results in substantial performance hits. Proving without a Merkle tree rules out existing generalist rollup frameworks like the OP Stack as a basis for SVM rollups, and it also requires a more creative fault proof architecture.\n\nAt a high level, a fault proof requires:\n\n1. A commitment to inputs for a transaction,\n\n2. The transaction itself, and\n\n3. Proof that re-executing the transaction leads to a different output than what was specified onchain.\n\nThe input commitment is typically made by providing the Merkle root for the rollup’s state tree. Our executor will instead post a list of inputs and outputs (including account hashes and relevant global state) for each transaction, along with an index of the transaction which produced each input. The transactions are published to Celestia, so any full node can follow along to pull input accounts from its own state, compute the output accounts, and confirm that the commitment on Ethereum is correct.\n\nThere are two possible types of major faults:\n\n1. Incorrect outputs - In this case, the verifier provides a ZK proof onchain of the correct outputs. We’re using RISC Zero to create ZK proofs of SVM execution, [continuing our previous work proving BPF bytecode execution](https://github.com/Eclipse-Laboratories-Inc/zk-bpf). This allows our settlement contract to ensure correctness without having to run the transactions themselves onchain.\n\n2. Incorrect inputs - In this case, the verifier posts onchain a reference to the historical data showing that the input state is not as claimed. Using Celestia’s [Quantum Gravity Bridge](https://blog.celestia.org/celestiums/), our settlement contract ensures that this historical data does indeed prove fraud.\n\n# Why Eclipse, Why Ethereum, Why Now\n\nWe stand on the shoulders of giants. Today’s rollups have advanced the state of research for our entire industry, and they’ve provided Ethereum users with cheaper fees compared to the L1.\n\nHowever, they don’t take full advantage of the latest technology that’s needed to scale to the masses. Early rollups largely prioritized EVM-compatibility and/or optimizations for more efficient ZK-proving. More recently though, we’ve seen unbelievable progress which obviates the need to make those tradeoffs that early rollups chose, and indeed puts them at a disadvantage:\n\n* Highly performant parallelized VMs (e.g., SVM)\n\n* DA scaling with DAS light node support (e.g., Celestia)\n\n* Advances in proof infrastructure to make it practical anywhere (e.g., RISC Zero)\n\n* Increased portability of code (e.g., Neon and Solang) and users (e.g., MetaMask Snaps) across ecosystems\n\nEclipse has the massive benefit of hindsight. We get to learn from the limitations that other chains have faced then cherry-pick the best pieces to scale for the long-term.\n\n\u003chttps://twitter.com/0xMert_/status/1680271128537726976\u003e\n\n\u003chttps://twitter.com/colludingnode/status/1680285353662468097\u003e\n\nWe often hear about a future with a million app-specific rollups.\n\nConsensus-level customizations can be incredibly valuable for certain applications (e.g., [dYdX v4](https://dydx.exchange/blog/v4-technical-architecture-overview)), and we’re excited to help teams launch app-specific rollups.\n\nHowever, these cases are few and far between. That’s why most new rollups are still just vanilla EVM forks. Developers’ problems aren’t solved by fragmenting UX across more chains. The main use case for a million chains today often appears to be launching a million more tokens. The demand for full-stack customization simply doesn’t exist today for the vast majority of use cases.\n\nEven if the real demand was there, the infrastructure required to support many app-chains with competitive UX is years away (if it ever gets to par). Optimism’s Superchain (OP Stack), zkSync’s Hyperchains (ZK Stack), Arbitrum’s Orbit chains, and so on all have many-chain visions with shared infrastructure. This is intended to provide smoother UX operating between chains in the same ecosystem (e.g., between two chains within the Superchain) vs. completely isolated chains (e.g., between Ethereum and Solana).\n\nHowever, the current plans (where they exist) are still a far cry from ever being competitive with a single shared state. Furthermore, they don’t address interoperability across ecosystems (e.g., Superchain to a Hyperchain). Building modular shouldn’t mean building islands.\n\nIt’s more complicated for users to maintain accounts across many chains. It’s worse UX to keep bridging and worrying about what gas token you need. It’s more complicated and expensive to be reliant upon infrastructure providers for operating and maintaining so many chains.\n\nWe've always appreciated the simplicity of Solana’s vision. One highly optimized shared state machine with the scale to support the majority of valuable use cases. This is often viewed as incompatible with a rollup-centric roadmap, but that is simply not the case. We want to combine the best of both worlds.\n\nThis misconception arises due to the fact that today’s rollups are largely running the vanilla single-threaded EVM effectively unchanged in order to piggyback on early network effects. As a result, we often see [“dedicated blockspace” cited as the reason to deploy an app-specific rollup](https://blog.caldera.xyz/noisy-neighbor-problem/). Those crazy NFT mints shouldn’t jack up the prices for all the other apps on your chain, but the answer isn’t to go make your own chain. This is like using a sledgehammer to crack a peanut. You make painful and unnecessary tradeoffs (complexity, cost, worse UX, fragmented liquidity, etc.). The optimal solution is incredibly clear - just use a parallelized VM with local fee markets for state hotspots. That’s exactly what the SVM brings.\n\nEthereum is the intellectual, social, and economic center of crypto. Its Achilles’ heel has been scaling. DA scaling is still in the works, and the existing L2 execution environments can’t compete with newer innovations like the SVM. We fear that the Ethereum ecosystem would be caught flat-footed by any sharp increase in activity as it stands today. Single-threaded EVMs and constrained DA would quickly lead to a resurgence of high fees, except this time on rollups.\n\nWe believe Eclipse Mainnet is the obvious solution: uniting Solana’s performance with the security, verifiability, and network effects of the rollup-centric roadmap.\n\n# Parting Thoughts\n\nThe beauty of Ethereum is that it eats innovation. The [rollup-centric roadmap](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698) is the epitome of this, delegating execution and innovation to the free market. L2s have the incredible ability to leverage Ethereum’s network effects and settlement assurances while experimenting with the best new execution environments. Eclipse Mainnet is the natural fulfillment of this vision.\n\nIf a more performant execution layer comes along some day, we’ll be incredibly excited to see it deployed as a competitive Ethereum L2. Until then, the SVM remains the standard.\n\nTo get involved, reach out to us at team@eclipse.builders for testnet instructions.","digest":"me7bXLWJDS177V6nl8j1uzF1mxpX6nbGOLNeyBAwXgs","title":"Introducing Eclipse Mainnet: The Ethereum SVM L2","publishedAtTimestamp":1695141918,"writingNFT":{"__ref":"WritingNFTType:V0_RY9xRdF2WqCETDVyabKQTwnPHi9t7hvRIs8PDMVM"},"collectorBubbles":[{"__typename":"WritingNFTCollectorType","_id":"560","address":"0xF55a6bBe2971c636605eE369fb9374e2EEB9Fb71","project":{"__ref":"ProjectType:0xF55a6bBe2971c636605eE369fb9374e2EEB9Fb71"}},{"__typename":"WritingNFTCollectorType","_id":"554","address":"0x67822171e30b633DB56fBf556051aa66b9221d79","project":{"__ref":"ProjectType:0x67822171e30b633DB56fBf556051aa66b9221d79"}},{"__typename":"WritingNFTCollectorType","_id":"552","address":"0x21a8Be8B08672bcABc39d9bF368E9eDF4280CaA5","project":{"__ref":"ProjectType:0x21a8Be8B08672bcABc39d9bF368E9eDF4280CaA5"}}],"featuredImage":{"__typename":"MediaAssetType","mimetype":"image/png","url":"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aRq6d6hmCVb-Lcp3wKDg4.png?height=1280\u0026width=2560"},"publisher":{"__typename":"PublisherType","project":{"__ref":"ProjectType:0xe415Bc8724C2003e934F44A9165eF2dECCB6B8C5"},"member":{"__ref":"ProjectType:0xe415Bc8724C2003e934F44A9165eF2dECCB6B8C5"}},"settings":{"__typename":"EntrySettingsType","description":"","metaImage":null,"title":""}},"ROOT_QUERY":{"__typename":"Query","projectFeed({\"limit\":9,\"projectAddress\":\"eclipselabs.eth\"})":{"__ref":"ProjectType:0xe415Bc8724C2003e934F44A9165eF2dECCB6B8C5"}}}},"__N_SSP":true},"page":"/_sites/[slug]","query":{"slug":"eclipselabs.eth"},"buildId":"nSWXq5GTCW3f5f61TglZS","isFallback":false,"gssp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script><next-route-announcer><p aria-live="assertive" id="__next-route-announcer__" role="alert" style="border: 0px; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); height: 1px; margin: -1px; overflow: hidden; padding: 0px; position: absolute; top: 0px; width: 1px; white-space: nowrap; overflow-wrap: normal;"></p></next-route-announcer></body></html>
