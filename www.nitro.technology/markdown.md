# Layer 2

Nitro is building a modular scalability engine for SVM rollups. This unlocks
new possibilities for blockchain architecture, such as Nitroâs first SVM-
based rollups on Ethereum and Cosmos.

# Solana Virtual Machine

Nitro is powered by the SVM, a pioneer in the history of blockchain virtual
machines. It introduced many groundbreaking innovations to the community--
parallel processing, local fee markets, and token extensions. The SVM is a
beacon of maturity in the altVM universe and serves as the foundation for a
thriving ecosystem of projects.

# A Gateway to  
the Beyond

Nitro acts as an abstraction layer to create an execution environment for the
SVM with any underlying Layer 1. This not only broadens the reach of Solana
mainnet but also empowers developers to access a vast pool of users and
liquidity across Ethereum, Cosmos, and beyond. Nitro is redefining
interoperability, making it simpler than ever for teams to unleash their
projects' full potential.
