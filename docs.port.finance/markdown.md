# 📊Introduction to Port Finance

Port Finance is a non-custodial money market protocol on Solana. Its goals are
to bring a whole suite of interest rate product including: variable rate
lending, fixed rate lending and interest rate swap to the Solana blockchain.

The current variable rate product features variable interest rates based on
supply & demand, cross collateral lending, and flash loans.

The fixed-rate lending product uses the model of zero coupon bond. We allow
lender to lend at a fixed rate and allow borrower to take on fixed-rate,
fixed-term loan.

Port Finance seeks to be the liquidity gateway for the Solana DeFi ecosystem
through simpler user interfaces, lower collateral requirements, and adjustable
liquidation thresholds based on volatility and liquidity.

Port’s native token will enable users to participate in governance and share
in protocol fees derived from all protocol products.
