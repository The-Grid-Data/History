If you're interested in purchasing cryptocurrencies, centralised exchanges
(CEXs) such as [Binance](https://www.binance.com),
[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com), or [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com) are
the most conventional places to do so at the moment.

In recent years, there has also been a rise in decentralised exchanges (DEXs).
DEXs offer the same products and services as CEXs, except they offer it on a
decentralised and transparent blockchain rather than on a private centralised
server.

In this guide weâll take a look at both centralised exchanges and
decentralised exchanges and evaluate how they differ from one another.

## **Centralised Exchange (CEX)**

Centralised exchanges (CEXs) are trading platforms or marketplaces that are
owned and operated by corporate organisations. As such, centralised exchanges
act as a âmiddle manâ between buyers and sellers of digital assets such as
cryptocurrencies.

Users of a centralised exchange trust the exchange to conduct buy and sell
orders on their behalf and secure their digital assets.

Some of the most notable centralised exchanges in the crypto space are
[Binance](https://www.binance.com), [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com), or
[Kraken.](https://www.kraken.com)

### **Benefits of a Centralised Exchange (CEX)**

  * _Onboarding_

The onboarding process of CEXs is generally simple, which appeals to everyone,
ranging from beginners to professionals.

  * _Safety_

Another benefit of CEXs is that your digital assets are safely stored in a
custodial wallet and support is offered in case of loss of funds (for the most
part).

  * _Liquidity_

CEXs also boast the largest pool of traders and users. In turn, this gives
CEXs the biggest cash flow and the largest amounts of liquidity. This enables
CEXs to transact orders of larger sizes, at any time.

### **Disadvantages of a Centralised Exchange (CEX)**

  * _Restrictions & Limitations_

Some CEXs have been banned or restricted in particular countries or regions.
Also, some CEXs are known for the limited amount of digital assets they offer.

  * _Opacity_

CEXs are opaque. There is no way to easily verify the number of assets held,
the number of liabilities faced and the overall health of CEXs. In the same
context, itâs difficult to assess if CEXs have made undisclosed deals with
specific market makers and power users.

  * _Custodial Wallet_

Your digital assets on a CEX are stored in a custodial wallet. This means the
CEX has control over your digital assets and could even freeze these or
deplatform you if they see the need to do so. If the CEX faces an insolvency
event, usersâ digital assets will belong to the CEX and users will need to
join a long line of creditors in the ensuing insolvency proceedings.

For more on the disadvantages of centralised entities, read our [Web2 vs.
Web3](https://www.drift.trade/blog/web2-vs-web3) guide.

## **Decentralised Exchange (DEX)**

Decentralised exchanges (DEXs) are trading platforms or marketplaces that are
not owned by centralised/corporate organisations.

DEXs are, as the name suggests, decentralised and permissionless and are most
commonly found on blockchains such as Ethereum and Solana.

There are generally 2 types of decentralised exchanges worth noting:
Orderbook-based DEXs and AMM-based DEXs.

  * _Orderbook-Based DEX_

An orderbook-based DEX is a platform that uses a more traditional central
limit order book (CLOB) system for its trading infrastructure.

  * _AMM-based DEX_

An AMM-based DEX is a platform that uses Automated Market Makers (AMM) for its
trading infrastructure. AMMs generally work based on algorithms and
mathematical formulas.

Head over to our [Hybrid Liquidity
Mechanism](https://www.drift.trade/updates/hybrid-liquidity-mechanism) article
to read more about the technical details of [Drift](https://www.drift.trade).  

### **Benefits of a Decentralised Exchange (DEX)**

  * _Permissionlessness_

Anyone, from anywhere in the world, can freely access and participate in a
DEX. DEXs are also accessed with non-custodial wallets, meaning that you
custody all the assets you use on the DEX.

For more on this, read our [Best Solana
Wallets](https://www.drift.trade/blog/best-solana-wallets) guide.

  * _Transparency_

DEXs are built on public blockchains. This means that all transactions are
immutable and publicly available. Every user can see the number of total
deposits, daily transactions, volume traded etc. by parsing on chain data.
Additionally, if the code is open sourced, any user can verify the fairness
and integrity of the protocol.

  * _Variety_

Typically, DEXs offer a significantly wider selection of digital assets than
CEXs. If youâre scouting niche products, a DEX is more likely to have what
youâre looking for compared to a CEX.

â

### **Disadvantages of a Decentralised Exchange (DEX)**

  * _Onboarding_

In order to use DEXs, you need to set up and learn how to use a [non-custodial
wallet](https://www.drift.trade/blog/best-solana-wallets). This initial step
and its learning curve can prove to be difficult for some people, especially
beginners.

  * _Regulation_

As DEXs aim to be less regulated compared to CEXs, there may be fewer
protections in place for users. This means that users should do their due
diligence prior to trading.

  * _Network Congestion_

As mentioned previously, DEXs run on blockchains such as Solana. During
periods of high traffic, certain blockchains are susceptible to network
congestion. In turn, this may affect trades on the DEX themselves.

centralised exchanges (CEXs) and decentralised exchanges (DEXs).
