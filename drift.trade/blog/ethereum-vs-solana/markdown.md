A blockchain is a network of peer-to-peer computers that all have the same
records stored, resulting in a system that is difficult to attack or
manipulate.

Of the public blockchains, Ethereum and Solana are arguably two of the most
prolific.

In this guide, weâll take a look at the origin stories of both Ethereum and
Solana, and highlight the individual strengths and weaknesses of each.

## **The Scalability Trilemma** â

To grasp how blockchains differ from one another, we first need to understand
the [Scalability
Trilemma](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/04/07/sharding.html).

![](https://assets-global.website-
files.com/6310e7dee49f08e5798eed50/63cf9f2608aee6466da7520a_Scalability%20Trilemma.png)

The term was coined by Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, and lays out
three characteristics the ideal blockchain would need to have:
decentralisation, scalability, and security.

Vitalik also poses that it is near impossible for a blockchain to achieve all
three characteristics well, so trade-offs occur.

As a result, all major blockchains today compromise on one of the
characteristics in or order to successfully achieve the other two.

## **Ethereum vs. Solana**

Below we'll dive into how Ethereum and Solana differ from one another, and how
their strengths and weaknesses stack up.

## **Ethereum**

â _With respect to the the scalability trilemma, Ethereum prioritises
security and decentralisation over scalability_

![](https://assets-global.website-
files.com/6310e7dee49f08e5798eed50/63cf9f0971a7651016825911_Scalability%20Trilemma_Ethereum.png)

Ethereum, the blockchain powering the Ether cryptocurrency ($ETH), was co-
founded by Vitalik Buterin and initially released in 2015.

The origin story of Ethereum is an integral part of Web3 lore. Vitalik set out
to create Ethereum due to an incident involving World of Warcraft. From 2007
to 2010 he played the game, quickly rising through the ranks. Blizzard, the
gaming studio behind the game, apparently removed the damage component of his
warlockâs Siphon Life spell. This significantly weakened the character and
made Vitalik realise âwhat horrors centralised services can bringâ.

When he was introduced to blockchain technology and Bitcoin in 2011, he began
to imagine a world without centralised services. However, he found the Bitcoin
blockchain to be too restrictive, as it only allowed for a limited number of
financial use cases.

In 2014, he released a [white paper](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/)
describing what would ultimately become Ethereum. Later that year, Vitalik and
other co-founders launched a successful crowdsourcing campaign and Ethereum
launched. Since its initial release in 2015, the Ethereum blockchain has grown
rapidly and onboarded a significant number of developers.

Ethereum's key differentiator from the Bitcoin blockchain is its ability to
trade more than just cryptocurrency â this is because it allows for smart
contracts and dApps (decentralised applications) to be built on top of it. The
native token of the Ethereum blockchain, Ether or $ETH, is commonly used to
interact with and carry out transactions of these smart contracts and dApps.
Ether can be used to buy and trade cryptocurrencies and other digital assets
such as NFTs (non-fungible tokens). With the rise of DeFi (decentralised
finance) and NFTs, Ether has skyrocketed.

Initially, Ether was created by means of âminingâ and the corresponding
âproof of workâ consensus mechanism â similar to Bitcoin. However, since
this is energy intensive,  Ethereum switched to the â[proof of
stake](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/)â
consensus mechanism in 2022.

### **Ethereum: Strengths**

####  _Decentralisation_

Validators are responsible for adding new blocks to a blockchain, processing
transactions and storing data, and are a backbone of blockchain technology.
Since the [technological
requirement](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/) to
become an Ethereum validator is relatively low, more people can run Ethereum
validators profitably. This makes Ethereum less dependent on any one
validator, which in turn results in a more decentralised network.

![](https://assets-global.website-
files.com/6310e7dee49f08e5798eed50/63cf9f5e9f416b841122e9f3_Ethereum_Decentralisation.png)

#### _Security_

The hashrate measures how many calculations per second the Ethereum blockchain
can perform. Due to [Ethereumâs high
hashrate](https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/ethereum/hashrate-chart), it would
take extremely expensive hardware and computational power to [hack the
blockchain](https://www.crypto51.app/). Ill-intentioned or dishonest
validators are subject to punishment, which further disincentives them from
acting maliciously.

#### _Ecosystem_

Currently, Ethereum is home to the most sophisticated DeFi ecosystem. The
ecosystem is made up by renown brands such as Maker, Uniswap and AAVE and
continues to grow. When looking at the [total
revenue](https://tokenterminal.com/terminal/metrics/total-revenue) the
Ethereum blockchain generates, itâs apparent that the network is still the
market leader when it comes to blockchain profitability.

### **Ethereum: Weaknesses**

####  _Speed_

The highest number of transactions performed per second (TPS) for the Ethereum
blockchain was measured at [108](https://ethtps.info/) â slower than other
major blockchains. Ethereum 2.0 looks to address this and envisages [TPS up to
100,000](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/sharding/#data-
availability:~:text=Rollups%20are%20a,transactions%20per%20second.).

#### _Scalability_

Ethereum prioritises security and decentralisation over scalability. As a
result, the transaction costs (gas fees) on the blockchain can be
[expensive](https://etherscan.io/gastracker) in periods of high network usage
â pricing out a significant number of users.

#### _Reliance_ â

Although decentralisation is one of Ethereumâs strengths, the blockchain has
been criticised for its reliance on [centralised cloud
services](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/ethereums-infura-
iating-outage-revives-decentralization-concerns) such as Infura and AWS.
Critics argue that Ethereum is not fully decentralised, because if services
like Infura and AWS were to shut down, so would the majority of dApps on the
blockchain itself. This was the case in [April
2022](https://decrypt.co/98457/metamask-ethereum-apps-down-infura-outage),
when a number of Ethereum dApps went offline as Infura experienced a service
outage.

## **Solana**

 _With respect to the scalability trilemma, Solana prioritises security and
scalability over decentralisation._

![](https://assets-global.website-
files.com/6310e7dee49f08e5798eed50/63cf9f8e20873b74215f6647_Scalability%20Trilemma_Solana.png)

  
Because of its popularity, the speed of the Ethereum blockchain has become
sluggish and transactions expensive at times of high usage. Ethereum is tough
to scale, making the onboarding of millions of new users difficult. Even with
the upgrade to Ethereum 2.0 these challenges might not be sufficiently
alleviated.

There are numerous alternatives to Ethereum, one of which is Solana.

âSolanaâ refers to a beach in San Diego, California, where Anatoly
Yakovenko, the co-founder of the blockchain, worked nearby. Before starting
the Solana project in 2017, Anatoly worked at Qualcomm and Dropbox as an
engineer.

The Solana blockchain was developed to address the issues both the Bitcoin and
Ethereum blockchains face. The blockchain scales really well and allows for a
high number of transactions per second â all while staying cost-effective.
Solana, often referred to as SOL, is the native cryptocurrency of the Solana
blockchain.

Similar to Ether, SOL can be used to interact with and carry out transactions
of smart contracts and dApps. SOL can also be used to buy and trade
cryptocurrencies and other digital assets such as NFTs. The popularity of DeFi
and NFTs has raised the profile of the Solana blockchain.

The blockchain applied the âproof of stakeâ consensus mechanism from the
outset, which has a significantly lighter environmental impact than the
âproof of workâ consensus mechanism currently utilised by the Bitcoin
blockchain (and Ethereum in the past).

In [June 2022](https://solana.com/news/saga-reveal), Solana announced plans to
enter the mobile space by introducing a flagship Android smartphone â Saga
â and an open source software development kit (SDK), dubbed Solana Mobile
Stack (SMS).

The aim of this initiative:

  * _Make interactions with the Solana blockchain mobile-friendly and seamless._
  * _Bypass the restrictions of the iOS App Store and Android Google Play Store._
  * _Put pressure on incumbents such as Apple and Samsung to integrate Web3 native hardware and software components._

Solanaâs energy efficiency, easier scalability, cost-effective transactions
and mobile-first focus have all contributed to the heightened profile of the
blockchain.

### **Solana: Strengths**

####  _Speed_

Theoretically, the Solana blockchain can reach [50,000
TPS](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/did-already-know-cryptocurreny-
solana-142151726.html) with the actual TPS hovering between [2,000 to 3,000
TPS](https://analytics.solscan.io/public/dashboard/8d888828-baae-47b9-948b-d087e5de1411?select_report_period=thisyear)
most of the time. Solanaâs TPS is much higher than Ethereumâs, providing
not only faster transactions and a better user experience, but also the
ability to develop and introduce new blockchain innovations.

#### _Fees_

Solana prioritises security and scalability over decentralisation. As a
result, transaction costs on the Solana blockchain mostly cost less than a
cent for a [single
transaction](https://analytics.solscan.io/public/dashboard/8d888828-baae-47b9-948b-d087e5de1411?select_report_period=thisyear#:~:text=0.0000053,Vote%20Transaction%20\(SOL\)),
even during periods of high network usage. This is not only more beneficial
for current users, but also a wider range of other users who are looking for a
better blockchain experience.

#### _Developers_ â

In the last couple of years, Solana has seen an influx of ecosystem grants and
VC activity. This has helped to attract developers to build on Solana and
further push the ecosystem forward. In 2022 alone, the number of monthly
active developers within the Solana ecosystem grew by
[83%.](https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/18/solana-co-founder-sees-potential-for-
devs-to-lead-its-network-
in-2023/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly90LmNvLw&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAESB5L1biXDYUzYvJf0Hs3T_zJ8BfZO_2fdUTQxCvj3kIxAdE3NkxwswJgSIZuTpmCk73NOP42P4NzCnNDYu7pLBo_hRhU39Bty6WoUTicYBqfALvDKNVpUGgf39Wf_2y84Npm3oFJOykFj7jr6BiVVgMujmmaA5s3t4gDdT4ggs)

### **Solana: Weaknesses**

####  _Decentralisation_

The barrier to entry is still high for people that want to run Solana
validators. The recommended [hardware
requirement](https://docs.solana.com/running-validator/validator-reqs) to run
a Solana validator is a 12 core CPU, 128GB of RAM and over 1TB of disk space.
For an Ethereum validator, the minimum [hardware
requirement](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/)
encompasses a 2 core CPU, 4GB of RAM and any SSD. For most, it makes sense to
source/build a custom rig to run a Solana validator, while an Ethereum
validator can run on everyday laptops. Since the technologic requirement is
high, becoming a Solana validator is not easy. This makes Solana more
dependent on existing validators, which in turn results in a more centralised
network.

files.com/6310e7dee49f08e5798eed50/63d0f58d13b546de18916f79_Solana_Decentralisation.png)

#### â _Outages_

Due to its rapid growth, the Solana blockchain still suffers from [degraded
performance and outage issues](https://status.solana.com/history) from time to
time. Network outages are critical, as they lead to slow transactions and
dApps not working properly â leading to frustrated users and a subpar user
experience. These seem to be growing pains, which Ethereum also has (see
âRelianceâ section above).

#### _Ecosystem_

The number of major protocols on Ethereum [significantly
outweigh](https://defillama.com/chains) the protocols on Solana. Additionally,
the revenue the Solana blockchain [generates through
transactions](https://tokenterminal.com/terminal/metrics/total-revenue) is
nothing close to that of Ethereum. However, with the recent introduction of
[fee market
innovations](https://twitter.com/crypto_notte/status/1552687445493235713?s=20&t=zS69pTHT9kPqW_ihNHgGPA),
the Solana blockchain will be able to ramp up its revenue significantly.
