Arbitrage has always been a popular trading strategy. This is true for stocks,
forex, and commodities, and has most recently gained popularity in
cryptocurrencies over the last 10 years.

This guide will highlight what an arbitrage is, how it works, and how you can
benefit from arbitraging between a CEX and DEX.

## **What Is Arbitrage?**

An arbitrage is the process of taking advantage of market inefficiencies. It
involves buying an asset in one market and selling it in a different market,
profiting from the price difference between the two. An arbitrage benefits
both the arbitrageur and the market itself. The arbitrageur gains a profit and
the market inefficiency is corrected.

## **How To Arbitrage Between CEXs & DEXs**

Generally, there are two common methods when arbitraging (also known as
âarbingâ for short) between a centralised exchange (CEX) and a
decentralised exchange (DEX): (1) funding rate arbitrage and (2) price
arbitrage.

### **_Funding rate arbitrage_**

A funding rate arbitrage takes advantage of funding rates on perpetual future
exchanges.

When the prices of perpetual futures deviate from the index/spot price of
their corresponding assets, funding rates are paid out by centralised
exchanges (Binance, Coinbase or Kraken) and decentralised exchanges
([Drift](https://www.drift.trade)) as periodic payments (typically hourly).
These funding rates motivate traders to open either short or long positions to
help bring the prices of perpetual futures back (i.e. closer) to the spot
prices of their corresponding assets.

For example, Binance (CEX) might quote the hourly funding rate for SOL-PERP at
0.003%, while Drift (DEX) quotes the hourly funding rate for SOL-PERP at
-0.00511%.

**This is an arbitrage opportunity.**

_For more on funding rates, consider reading our â_[ _What Are Perpetual
Futures / Perpetual Swap Contracts?_](https://www.drift.trade/blog/perpetual-
futures)_â guide._

![](https://assets-global.website-
files.com/6310e7dee49f08e5798eed50/6358f2dcc76bc830d099c08d_CEX%20%26%20DEX_Funding%20Rate%20Arbitrage.png)

  
You could take a short SOLUSDT-Perpetual position on Binance, and a long SOL-
PERP position on Drift. By doing so, you can collect a net hourly funding rate
payment of 0.00481% on your position size.

Hereâs a step by step guide:

#### _Step 1: Identify funding rates_

Navigate to the perpetual futures market for SOLUSDT-Perpetual/SOL-PERP on
both Binance and Drift. Identify if there is a significant difference in
funding rates between the perpetual market on both platforms.

![](https://assets-global.website-
files.com/6310e7dee49f08e5798eed50/63b7b42f4e235a91a6fcead9_image4.png)

  
In our example, the hourly funding rate of SOLUSDT-Perpetual on Binance is
-0.0253%, while the hourly funding rate on Drift is 0.00032%.

If there is an insignificant or no funding rate difference at all, do not
proceed to the next step and wait for a better opportunity.

files.com/6310e7dee49f08e5798eed50/63b7b5043c98bc62cb401303_image2.png)

#### â _  
Step 2: Long SOLUSDT-Perpetual on Binance_

Next, navigate to the search bar on Binance at the top of the screen and type
in âSOLUSDT-Perpetualâ. Once you reach the SOLUSDT-Perpetual page,
youâll be able to sell i.e. short SOL, either by means of a market or a
limit order. Review and confirm your trade details.

#### _Step 3: Short SOL-PERP on Drift_

Navigate to Drift and select SOL-PERP from the drop down menu. Once you reach
the SOL-PERP page, youâll be able to sell i.e. short SOL-PERP, either by
means of a market or a limit order. Review and confirm your trade details.

files.com/6310e7dee49f08e5798eed50/63b7b576bc8f206e1f72c6b1_image3.png)

â**  
Note: Steps 2 and 3 should be done at the same time.**

#### _Step 4: Periodically monitor funding rates_

Going forward, youâll need to periodically monitor the funding rates, both
on Binance and Drift. Youâve now successfully entered a delta neutral
position while collecting a net hourly funding rate of 0.02498%. Should the
funding rate on Drift no longer be positive or the funding rate on Binance no
longer be negative, you should close both perpetual futures positions as soon
as possible as you can no longer be profitable due to funding rate payments.

### **_Price arbitrage_**

A price arbitrage takes advantage of price inefficiencies in spot markets.
CEXs and DEXs sometimes quote different prices for the same digital asset.

For example, a CEX like Binance might quote the current price of SOL at US$
13.179, while a DEX like [Orca](https://www.orca.so) quotes the current price
of SOL at US$ 13.21.

**This is an arbitrage opportunity.**

![](https://assets-global.website-
files.com/6310e7dee49f08e5798eed50/63b7ce0eccaa82337db041bb_CEX%20%26%20DEX_Price%20Arbitrage.png)

  
You could buy SOL on Binance for US$ 13.179, and sell it on Orca for US$
13.21.

By doing so, you can make a profit of US$ 0.031 for each SOL sold on Orca.

Hereâs a step by step guide:

#### _Step 1: Identify price inefficiency_

Check SOL/USDT on Binance and SOL/USDC on Orca and identify if there is a
significant price difference between the two spot market pairs.

![](https://assets-global.website-
files.com/6310e7dee49f08e5798eed50/63b7b789104ab2d629b69d67_image9.png)

  
If there is an insignificant or no price difference at all, wait for a better
opportunity.

![](https://assets-global.website-
files.com/6310e7dee49f08e5798eed50/63b7b7ca8f90f93a2c261427_image5.png)

  
In our example, SOL on Binance is US$ 13.179 and US$ 13.21 on Orca, indicating
a US$ 0.031 premium and thus a viable arbitrage opportunity.

#### _Step 2: Buy SOL_

Find the âSOL/USDTâ pair on Binance. Once you reach the spot market page,
youâll be able to purchase SOL, either by means of a market or a limit
order. Review and confirm your purchase details.

#### â _Step 3: Transfer SOL_

After a successful purchase, youâll be able to see the SOL youâve bought
in your Binance wallet. Navigate to the âFiat&Spotâ section and select the
âWithdrawâ button.

Opt for "Withdraw Crypto" and a withdrawal page will be prompted where you can
select "SOL", enter the amount you wish to withdraw and your withdrawal
destination.

For more details, take a look at the video below.

â _  
For more on non-custodial wallets, read our â_[ _Solana
Wallet_](https://www.drift.trade/blog/best-solana-wallets) _â guide._

Once youâve confirmed your withdrawal details, select the âWithdrawâ
button.

#### _Step 4: Sell SOL_

When your SOL tokens are available, go to Orca and connect your Solana wallet.
Proceed to the âSwapâ page of the DEX and configure the swap from SOL to
USDC. Make sure that the SOL to USDC rate is still US$ 31.21 or at least
higher than what you purchased it for on Binance.

files.com/6310e7dee49f08e5798eed50/63b7b9d18f90f94fbc2737c5_image6.png)

  
Click on the âMaxâ button for your SOL to select the entire amount you
purchased. Start the process by clicking on the âTradeâ button and confirm
the transaction within your Solana wallet. After swapping, youâve now
successfully arbitraged SOL tokens between Binance and Orca for a profit of
US$ 0.031/SOL minus fees.

## **Bots & Algorithms**

A majority of the most profitable traders utilise custom bots and algorithms
which allow them to spot and take advantage of arbitrage opportunities
quickly, without constantly monitoring market movements. Moreover, bots and
algorithms allow arbitrageurs to exit positions quickly, should funding rates
begin to change.

Conducting manual arbitrage is not as advantageous as using bots & algorithms,
but is still often utilised successfully. If you'd like to learn more about
this topic, we suggest exploring arbitrage bots and algorithms in greater
detail.
