Limit orders are orders to buy or sell a specific asset at a predetermined
price. Traders can specify the limit price at which they want their order to
be filled. When a limit order is placed, it remains active until the asset
reaches the specified price or better, or the order is cancelled.

Limit orders can be useful for traders who want to buy or sell an asset at a
specific price, rather than at the current market price. This can help traders
to control the price at which they enter or exit a position, and to avoid the
risks associated with sudden price movements.

Also, limit orders serve as a maximum slippage tolerance, protecting traders
from unfavourable prices caused by sudden market movements.

Lastly, there is no guarantee that a limit order will be executed, as the
asset may not reach the specified price or gap above or below the specified
trigger price.

For more on this, read our [order types](https://www.drift.trade/learn/order-
types) guide.

Letâs now take a look specifically at stop loss and take profit orders.

## **Order Type: Stop Loss** â

To minimise the risk of losses, traders can use various risk management
strategies, such as diversifying their portfolio and setting up stop loss
orders.

Stop loss orders are a type of order that is used to close the position of a
specific asset if its mark price reaches a specified trigger price.

Stop loss orders can be useful for traders who want to limit their potential
losses while still allowing their investments to participate in the market's
potential gains.

For example, if a trader buys SOL-PERP at $25, he can set a stop loss order at
$22 i.e. when the price falls to or below $22, the corresponding SOL-PERP
position will be sold. The trader can limit his potential losses to $3 per
SOL-PERP, even if the price continues to decline. In this context, the stop
loss order remains in effect until it is filled or cancelled.

## **Stop Loss On Drift**

On Drift, you can choose between two types of stop loss orders: stop limit and
stop market.

Both stop limit and stop market orders are triggered based on your stop price.
However, the stop limit order, after triggered, will create a limit order,
while the stop market order will create a market order.

Letâs take âstop limitâ as an example: Weâll buy SOL-PERP at $22, so
we key in $22 at âLimit Priceâ. To protect our downside, we key in $20 at
âTrigger priceâ. We complete our order by keying in the order size and
confirming our trade.

files.com/6310e7dee49f08e5798eed50/640ee0077dcbf31e12ba95a6_Stop%20Loss.png)

In case SOL-PERP rises in price, we benefit and can choose what to do next.
Should SOL-PERP go down to $20 or below, our position will be closed and sold
as a limit order.

## **Order Type: Take Profit**

âTake profitâ is a term used in investing and trading that refers to an
order that executes when a financial asset reaches a specified price.

The price level is set by the trader, and it is usually higher than the
current market price of a financial asset. Basically, the purpose of a take
profit order is to lock in profits on an investment.

For example, if a trader buys SOL-PERP at $25, he can set a take profit order
at $28 i.e. when the price rises to or above $28, the corresponding SOL-PERP
position will be closed and sold. The trader earns $3 per SOL-PERP, even if
the price continues to rise. As such, the take profit order remains in effect
until it is filled or cancelled.

## **Take Profit On Drift**

On Drift, you can choose between two types of take profit orders: take profit
and take profit limit.

Both take profit and take profit limit orders are triggered based on your stop
price. However, the take profit order, after triggered, will create a market
order, while the take profit limit order will create a limit order.

Letâs take âtake profit limitâ as an example: Weâll buy SOL-PERP at
$22, so we key in $22 at âLimit Priceâ. To lock in profit on the upside,
we key in $25 at âTrigger priceâ. We complete the order by keying in the
order size and confirming our trade.

![](https://assets-global.website-
files.com/6310e7dee49f08e5798eed50/640edfe9d92daa45de777daf_Take%20Profit.png)

In case SOL-PERP declines in price, weâd need to decide what to do next.
Should SOL-PERP increase in price and reach $25 or beyond, our position will
be sold as a limit order and weâd lock in $3 per SOL-PERP.

  * [Just-in-Time (JIT) Liquidity Mechanism](https://www.drift.trade/updates/jit-liquidity-mechanism)

## **Limit Orders: Risks**

It's important to note that limit orders are not foolproof, and they do not
guarantee that a trader will be able to sell at the specified price. In fast-
moving markets, it's possible for a financial asset to gap above or below the
specified trigger price, causing the order either not to be filled or be
filled at a different price â which might be risky. Traders should always
consider their own risk tolerance and investment goals when deciding whether
to use limit orders.
