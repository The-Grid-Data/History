# Getting Started

Grass is the Data Layer of AI built as a Layer 2 Sovereign Data Rollup.

The infrastructure consists of two key components:

  1. Grass nodes allow users' devices to contribute their underutilized internet resources towards the development of AI models. 

  2. Sovereign Data Rollup consists of the network of nodes, routers, validator, ZK processor, and Data ledger which facilitates the data sourcing and transformation process — turning unstructured web data into structured datasets.
