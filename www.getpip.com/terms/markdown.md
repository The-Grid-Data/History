# **Term and Termination**  

These Terms of Use shall remain in full force and effect while you use the
Service. WITHOUT LIMITING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THESE TERMS OF USE, WE
RESERVE THE RIGHT TO, IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION AND WITHOUT NOTICE OR LIABILITY,
DENY ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE Service (INCLUDING BLOCKING CERTAIN IP
ADDRESSES), TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY REASON OR FOR NO REASON, INCLUDING WITHOUT
LIMITATION FOR BREACH OF ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, OR COVENANT CONTAINED
IN THESE TERMS OF USE OR OF ANY APPLICABLE LAW OR REGULATION. WE MAY TERMINATE
YOUR USE OR PARTICIPATION IN THE Service OR DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT AND ANY
CONTENT OR INFORMATION THAT YOU POSTED AT ANY TIME, WITHOUT WARNING, IN OUR
SOLE DISCRETION.  
â  
If we terminate or suspend your account for any reason, you are prohibited
from registering and creating a new account under your name, a fake or
borrowed name, or the name of any third party, even if you may be acting on
behalf of the third party. In addition to terminating or suspending your
account, we reserve the right to take appropriate legal action, including
without limitation pursuing civil, criminal, and injunctive redress.  

# **Modifications and Interruptions**  

We reserve the right to change, modify, or remove the contents of the Service
at any time or for any reason at our sole discretion without notice. However,
we have no obligation to update any information on our Service. We also
reserve the right to modify or discontinue all or part of the Service without

We cannot guarantee the Service will be available at all times. We may
experience hardware, software, or other problems or need to perform
maintenance related to the Service, resulting in interruptions, delays, or
errors. We reserve the right to change, revise, update, suspend, discontinue,

any downtime or discontinuance of the Service. Nothing in these Terms of Use
will be construed to obligate us to maintain and support the Service or to
supply any corrections, updates, or releases in connection therewith.  

# **Governing Law**  

These Terms of Use and your use of the Service are governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of Wyoming applicable to agreements
made and to be entirely performed within the State of Wyoming, without regard
to its conflict of law principles.  

# **Dispute Resolution**  

** _Informal Negotiations  
_** To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy,
or claim related to these Terms of Use (each "Dispute" and collectively, the
"Disputes") brought by either you or us (individually, a "Party" and
collectively, the "Parties"), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate
any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at
least thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration. Such informal
negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.  
  
**_Binding Arbitration_** _  
_If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations,
the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally
and exclusively resolved through binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT
WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A
JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA")
and, where appropriate, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer
Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the
AAA website:[www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org). Your arbitration fees and your
share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules
and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. If such costs are
determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, we will pay all arbitration fees
and expenses. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the
submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a
decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless
requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any
award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where
otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the
arbitration will take place in Wyoming. Except as otherwise provided herein,
the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings
pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the
award entered by the arbitrator.  
â  
If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the
Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts
located in Wyoming, and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses
of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to
venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts. Application of the
United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and
the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) is excluded from
these Terms of Use.  
â  
If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party
will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this
provision found to be illegal or unenforceable, and such Dispute shall be
decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for
jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal
jurisdiction of that court.  
  
**_Restrictions_** _  
_The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute
between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no
arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right
or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to
utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for
any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of
the general public or any other persons.  
â  
** _Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration_** _  
_The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above
provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (a) any
Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of
the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or
arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or
unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision
is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to
arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to
be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of
competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and
the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
