Aurory is a game studio delivering immersive, free-to-play Web3 games and
experiences. We were founded in early 2021 and currently have over 70
employees, many of whom were former talents at reputable game studios such as
Ubisoft, Gameloft, EA, Warner Bros., Rovio, and more.

Together, alongside our community, we are building in the open towards a
vision of a robust ecosystem of multiple games, mini-games, and dApps. Each of
these experiences, which are all based around original lore, will utilize
interoperable assets, meaning that players can use them across the entire
platform.

Join us as we build the future of gaming!
