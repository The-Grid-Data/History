Render Network Foundation  

The Render NetworkÂ® is the leading provider of decentralized GPU based
rendering solutions, revolutionizing the digital creation process. The network
connects node operators looking to monetize their idle GPU compute power with
artists looking to scale intensive 3D rendering work and applications to the
cloud. Through a decentralized peer-to-peer network, the Render Network
achieves unprecedented levels of scale, speed, and economic efficiency. On top
of a decentralized GPU computing network, Render provides a platform for
artists and developers to build services and applications for the emerging
digital economy, including next generation digital rights management (DRM),
artificial intelligence (AI), and virtual assets (NFTs).

Launching Compute Clients

In 2023 the community voted in three Compute Clients to expand the core
direction of the network to include GPU compute (Compute Clients).

  

The community have voted for:  
  
[io.net](https://github.com/rendernetwork/RNPs/blob/main/RNP-004.md)

[Beem](https://github.com/rendernetwork/RNPs/blob/main/RNP-005.md)

[FedML](https://github.com/rendernetwork/RNPs/blob/main/RNP-007.md)

  

All are being implemented into the Render Network. If you are a GPU node
provider you [can sign up here and get on the network today.

Facilitation for AI Rendering Governance  

Our foundation facilitates the governance process through the Render Network
proposal (RNP) system. We are also responsible for helping set the strategic
priorities of the network and issuing grants to support them. If you are
looking to learn more about what Render does we have [created a series of
tutorials for you to get started](./tutorials). We would love to get you
involved. A history of community voting, as well as instructions on how our
community can come up with [their own RNPs is here.](./governance)
