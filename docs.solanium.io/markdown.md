# Introduction

The Solanium platform is a decentralized platform on the Solana blockchain.
The platform will introduce [**decentralized fundraising**](/the-solanium-
platform/pools), [**time-weighted token staking**](/the-solanium-
platform/staking) and [**governance voting**](/the-solanium-
platform/governance) to the Solana ecosystem.

We are giving high priority to both UI and UX, as we think good UI is one of
the core principles that are currently lacking or not prioritized in the
ecosystem. We feel that this is one of the most important factors to onboard
new(bie) users to the Solana ecosystem. The platform will be an all-in-one
solution for Solana, with integrated wallet, DEX and transaction management.
All major Solana wallets will be supported. The platform will extend any
connected wallet with inline wallet management. The user does not have to
leave the platform to see token balances, send or receive tokens or manage
token accounts. Experienced users can still manage their wallet through their
wallet provider, and any changes will directly be reflected on the platform.
