### FAQs

##### How long will Phase Three: Last Dash last?

![](https://assets-global.website-
files.com/65b94f15109a8df7c4e72150/65cd57a7d09139197f1506cf_Down%20-%20Blue%20Chevron.webp)

Phase Three: Last Dash began on May 13th, 2024 at 12:01 PM PDT. We will
announce the end of Phase Three at least 72 hours in advance. Once closed, the
price of Bee will increase.  
  
Phase One: Rapid Rush ended on March 15th, 2024 at 11:59 PM PDT.  
Phase Two: Steady Pace ended on May 13th, 2024 at 12 PM PDT.  

##### Do I get a HONEY bonus for pre-ordering Bee?

![](https://assets-global.website-
files.com/65b94f15109a8df7c4e72150/65cd57a7d09139197f1506cf_Down%20-%20Blue%20Chevron.webp)

Every unit ordered between Phase 1 and 2 will qualify for a HONEY bonus. Rapid
Rush provides the largest bonus between the three phases. The HONEY bonus
amount will be announced before the end of each phase.  
  
To claim the HONEY bonus, it is necessary to provide the original Bee purchase
order number. Purchases must be made through Hivemapper or authorized
distributors. Purchases made through unauthorized resellers are ineligible for
the HONEY bonus.  
  
_Note: Orders placed from December and January that were upgraded will receive
the HONEY bonus specified in your upgrade email._  

##### If I switch to Bee, do I still get the HONEY bonus for my order?

![](https://assets-global.website-
files.com/65b94f15109a8df7c4e72150/65cd57a7d09139197f1506cf_Down%20-%20Blue%20Chevron.webp)

If you convert an existing order to Bee, you are eligible for either the
original bonus offered at the time of order or the Rapid Rush bonus, whichever
is larger.

##### When will Bee ship?

![](https://assets-global.website-
files.com/65b94f15109a8df7c4e72150/65cd57a7d09139197f1506cf_Down%20-%20Blue%20Chevron.webp)

Bee will _start_ shipping in Q3 2024, beginning with upgraded units and
followed by Phase One: Rapid Rush preorders. We strictly follow our âfirst
order, first shipâ policy. If you are currently waiting for a Hivemapper
Dashcam or a Hivemapper Dashcam S and you upgrade your order to Bee, youâll
keep your place in line, and when Bee is ready to start shipping, will be
earlier in the queue. We encourage customers to switch and put themselves at
the front of the line for our best mapping machine yet.

##### Do I need to upgrade my existing order to Bee?

![](https://assets-global.website-
files.com/65b94f15109a8df7c4e72150/65cd57a7d09139197f1506cf_Down%20-%20Blue%20Chevron.webp)

**Hivemapper Dashcam S:** To fulfill as many orders as possible before the
launch of Bee, the next production run of the Hivemapper Dashcam S has been
canceled. All existing orders will be converted to Bee (with Cellular LTE and
WiFi) and a refund for the price difference will be **automatically** issued.
These customers will maintain their original order number for the purposes of
determining ship date. You will receive an automatic notification once your
upgrade has been **completed**.  
â  
**Hivemapper Dashcam:** We will produce the Hivemapper Dashcam for the next
several months as we gear up for Bee production; however, we encourage you to
switch to our best device ever. Bee has far more functionality and is expected
to earn greater rewards. Please check your email for a limited-time offer and
instructions on how to upgrade.

##### How do I upgrade my order if I haven't received an upgrade email?

![](https://assets-global.website-
files.com/65b94f15109a8df7c4e72150/65cd57a7d09139197f1506cf_Down%20-%20Blue%20Chevron.webp)

If you would like to upgrade your current order to a Bee, please fill out
[this
form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf4iLra50rb8SO7a2AwerEUjx8AYBy0XyoN1HktMXWmg31_FQ/viewform)
and we will reach out to you with instructions.

##### Will Bee work everywhere in the world?

![](https://assets-global.website-
files.com/65b94f15109a8df7c4e72150/65cd57a7d09139197f1506cf_Down%20-%20Blue%20Chevron.webp)

Yes, we are designing the Hivemapper Bee to work anywhere in the world that
Hivemapper Inc. is legally able to ship cameras.

##### **Is cellular LTE available worldwide?**

![](https://assets-global.website-
files.com/65b94f15109a8df7c4e72150/65cd57a7d09139197f1506cf_Down%20-%20Blue%20Chevron.webp)

Bee comes equipped with the necessary hardware for global onboard cellular
connectivity. Please be aware that at launch cellular connectivity may not be
available in all regions of the world.

##### **Are the cellular LTE service fees included in Beeâs price?**

![](https://assets-global.website-
files.com/65b94f15109a8df7c4e72150/65cd57a7d09139197f1506cf_Down%20-%20Blue%20Chevron.webp)

No, cellular LTE service fees are not included in the Beeâs price.
Additional charges may apply for LTE services.

##### Can I cancel my order and get a refund?

![](https://assets-global.website-
files.com/65b94f15109a8df7c4e72150/65cd57a7d09139197f1506cf_Down%20-%20Blue%20Chevron.webp)

Yes, you can cancel your Bee preorder at any time for a full refund. If you
take delivery and decide it isnât right for you, you have 14 days to
indicate your plans to return your Bee and another 14 days to return it.
Returned units will receive a full refund, less a $30 restocking fee, and are
ineligible for HONEY bonuses.
