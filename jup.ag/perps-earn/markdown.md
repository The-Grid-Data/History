The Jupiter Liquidity Provider (JLP) Pool is a liquidity pool where it acts as
a counterparty to traders â€” when traders seek to open leverage positions, they
borrow tokens from the pool.

The JLP token is the liquidity provider token where it's value is derived
from:

  * An index fund of .
  * Trader's profit and loss
  * 70% of the generated fees (Opening, closing and borrowing fees of positions and trading fees of the pool)

The APY, denominated in USD, is calculated based on 70% of fees generated from
perps trading activities which does not include assets appreciation and
traders PnL. The generated fees are distributed back to holders by
redepositing the fees into the pool hourly.
