## Sunsetting Elusiv V1: Transitioning Towards the Future of Privacy and
Confidentiality

Today, we are announcing the sunset of Elusiv, a pivotal chapter in our
mission to scale privacy in Web 3. Its success, driven by our communityâ€™s
tremendous trust and support, has laid the foundation for privacy to further
evolve and expand, serving as an essential catalyst to the mass adoption of
Web 3. As we move forward with an enhanced direction and vision, Elusiv will
remain the vital foundation of our story. From this moment. Elusiv will
transition to a withdrawal-only mode where users can withdraw their funds
until January 2025.

#### A note to the community

We are beyond grateful to the extended community that has supported our
mission so far. You have been a part of laying the groundwork required for
this entire space to evolve. For that, we thank you. We have taken a
comprehensive snapshot of the Elusiv protocol, aiming to take with us the
integrity and unity the Elusiv community has created as we transition toward a
bigger vision.
