# Welcome

Welcome to Symmetry, an on-chain asset management protocol that enables users
to create, manage, and trade tokenized baskets of multiple cryptocurrencies.

Protocol supports the creation and automation of mutable and immutable baskets
and supports up to 15 assets per basket composition with various weights.

Example: [Solana DeFi
Index](https://app.symmetry.fi/fund/9tZMvuRGbpEzv6RdR7GdtYzNpN8SE2Fub1WymoXsdpg),
which is a basket containing top Solana DeFi tokens by market cap, similar to
popular defi index on Ethereum called [DeFi Pulse
Index](https://indexcoop.com/products/defi-pulse-index).

On Symmetry, Rebalancing and restructuring of baskets are automated and
executed on-chain. Symmetry Baskets are customizable and can be used for
various purposes such as creating portfolios, indexes, ETFs, or copy-trading,
treasury management, etc...

The protocol is audited by [Ottersec](https://ottersec.notion.site/Sampled-
Public-Audit-
Reports-a296e98838aa4fdb8f3b192663400772?p=a4cf43a5136e419f89a2e4e20c723807&pm=s).

Example of what can be built using Symmetry infrastructure can be found at
[app.symmetry.fi](https://app.symmetry.fi), which is **open-source** and the
repository can be found [here](https://github.com/symmetry-protocol/baskets-
ui).

Symmetry Points are live and users are accumulating Points. Final snapshot
will be taken on May 31 ðŸ‘€

All users interacting with Symmetry through the app
([app.symmetry.fi](https://app.symmetry.fi)) or through any other protocol
that has Symmetry integrated are collecting Symmetry Points. A new UI of
Symmetry (which will be open-source) is coming on **March 5, 2024,** which
includes the user rankings & leaderboards, as well as a lot of new features.

Types of Baskets

Basket Type| Description| Potential Use-cases  
---|---|---  
Mutable| Creator can change composition tokens, change token weights,
rebalance the basket, adjust deposit fee, change basket description.| Public
Portfolios, Copy-trading, Portfolio Managers  
Immutable| After creation, the creator cannot modify any paramters or basket
composition.| Bundles, Diversification Tools  
Permissioned| A mutable basket with permissioned minting. Only the creator can
deposit into the basket, but anyone that has the basket tokens can redeem (if
the creator sends tokens to other addresses)| Treasury Management, Private
Portfolios, Gated Portfolios & copy-trading.  
  
In the symmetry app ([app.symmetry.fi](https://app.symmetry.fi)), these have
the following names:

  * Mutable Basket - Portfolio

  * Immutable Basket - Bundle

  * Permissioned Basket - Private Portfolio
