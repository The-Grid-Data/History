These include, but are not limited to, risk of losing access to cryptocurrency due to slashing, loss of private key(s), custodial error or purchaser error, risk of mining or blockchain attacks, risk of hacking and security weaknesses, risk of unfavorable regulatory intervention in one or more jurisdictions, risk related to token taxation, risk of personal information disclosure, risk of uninsured losses, volatility risks, and unanticipated risks.<br>
<!-- -->b) Smart contracts execute automatically when certain conditions are met. We do not have the ability to reverse a transaction that is recorded on a public blockchain. You are responsible for ensuring that any details entered you enter in connection with a transaction using any smart contracts are accurate and complete. Further, since smart contracts typically cannot be stopped or reversed, vulnerabilities in their programming and design or other vulnerabilities that may arise due to hacking or other security incidents can have adverse effects to digital assets, including but not limited to significant volatility and risk of loss.<br>
<!-- -->c) You acknowledge that there are inherent risks associated with using or interacting with public blockchains and blockchain technology. There is no guarantee that such technology will be unavailable or subject to errors, hacking or other security risks. Underlying blockchain protocols may also be subject to sudden changes in operating rules, including forks, and it is your responsibility to make yourself aware of upcoming operating changes.</p>
<p class="text-grey mb-10">6.4. Indemnification. By entering into these Terms and accessing or using the Services, you agree that you shall defend, indemnify and hold the Organization Entities harmless from and against any and all claims, costs, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including attorneys’ fees and costs) incurred by the Organization Entities arising out of or in connection with: (a) your violation or breach of any term of these Terms or any applicable law or regulation; (b) your violation of any rights of any third party; (c) your misuse of the Services; or (d) your negligence or wilful misconduct. If you are obligated to indemnify any Organization Entity hereunder, then you agree that Organization (or, at its discretion, the applicable Organization Entity) will have the right, in its sole discretion, to control any action or proceeding and to determine whether Organization wishes to settle, and if so, on what terms, and you agree to fully cooperate with Organization in the defense or settlement of such claim.<br>
<!-- -->6.5. Third Party Beneficiaries. You and the Organization acknowledge and agree that the Organization Entities (other than the Organization) are third party beneficiaries of these Terms, including under Sections 6 and</p>
<p class="text-grey mb-10">7.ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER</p>
<p class="text-grey mb-10">7.1 PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY HEAR YOUR CLAIMS. IT CONTAINS PROCEDURES FOR MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</p>
<p class="text-grey mb-10">7.2. Informal Process First.  You and the Organization agree that in the event of any dispute between you and the Organization Entities, either party will first contact the other party and make a good faith sustained effort to resolve the dispute before resorting to more formal means of resolution, including without limitation, any court action, after first allowing the receiving party 30 days in which to respond.  Both you and the Organization agree that this dispute resolution procedure is a condition precedent which must be satisfied before initiating any arbitration against the other party.</p>
<p class="text-grey mb-10">7.3. Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver.  After the informal dispute resolution process, any remaining dispute, controversy, or claim (collectively, “Claim”) relating in any way to the Services and any usage of the Protocol, will be resolved by arbitration, including threshold questions of arbitrability of the Claim. You and the Organization agree that any Claim will be settled by final and binding arbitration, using the English language, administered by JAMS under its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “JAMS Rules”) then in effect (those rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this section, and as of the date of these Terms).  Because your contract with the Organization, these Terms, and this Arbitration Agreement concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the arbitrability of all disputes. However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit. Arbitration will be handled by a sole arbitrator in accordance with the JAMS Rules. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court that has jurisdiction. Any arbitration under these Terms will take place on an individual basis – class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. You understand that by agreeing to these Terms, you and the Organization are each waiving the right to trial by jury or to participate in a class action or class arbitration.</p>
<p class="text-grey mb-10">7.4. Exceptions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you and the Organization agree that the following types of disputes will be resolved in a court of proper jurisdiction: (i) disputes or claims within the jurisdiction of a small claims court consistent with the jurisdictional and dollar limits that may apply, as long as it is brought and maintained as an individual dispute and not as a class, representative, or consolidated action or proceeding; (ii) disputes or claims where the sole form of relief sought is injunctive relief (including public injunctive relief); or (iii) intellectual property disputes.</p>
<p class="text-grey mb-10">7.5. Costs of Arbitration. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator costs and expenses will be governed by the JAMS Rules, except that if you demonstrate that any such costs and expenses owed by you under those rules would be prohibitively more expensive than a court proceeding, the Organization will pay the amount of any such costs and expenses that the arbitrator determines are necessary to prevent the arbitration from being prohibitively more expensive than a court proceeding (subject to possible reimbursement as set forth below).<br>
<!-- -->Fees and costs may be awarded as provided pursuant to applicable law. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the JAMS rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse the Organization for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the applicable rules. If you prevail in the arbitration and are awarded an amount that is less than the last written settlement amount offered by the Organization before the arbitrator was appointed, the Organization will pay you the amount it offered in settlement.  The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.</p>
<p class="text-grey mb-10">7.6. Opt-Out**. You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration provisions set forth in these Terms by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to <a href="mailto:legal@wormhole.foundation" class="text-plum cursor-pointer hover:opacity-60 transition-all">legal@wormhole.foundation</a>. The notice must be sent to the Organization within thirty (30) days of your first registering to use the Services or agreeing to these Terms; otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes on a non-class basis in accordance with these Terms. If you opt out of only the arbitration provisions, and not also the class action waiver, the class action waiver still applies.  You may not opt out of only the class action waiver and not also the arbitration provisions.  If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, the Organization also will not be bound by them.**</p>
<p class="text-grey mb-10">7.7. WAIVER OF RIGHT TO BRING CLASS ACTION AND REPRESENTATIVE CLAIMS**.** To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you and the Organization each agree that any proceeding to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy will be brought and conducted ONLY IN THE RESPECTIVE PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS PART OF ANY CLASS (OR PURPORTED CLASS), CONSOLIDATED, MULTIPLE-PLAINTIFF, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING (“CLASS ACTION”).  You and the Organization AGREE TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS ACTION.  You and the Organization EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY ABILITY TO MAINTAIN A CLASS ACTION IN ANY FORUM.  If the dispute is subject to arbitration, THE ARBITRATOR WILL NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO COMBINE OR AGGREGATE CLAIMS, CONDUCT A CLASS ACTION, OR MAKE AN AWARD TO ANY PERSON OR ENTITY NOT A PARTY TO THE ARBITRATION.  Further, you and the Organization agree that the ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS FOR MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, AND IT MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CLASS ACTION.  For the avoidance of doubt, however, you can seek public injunctive relief to the extent authorized by law and consistent with the Exceptions clause above.</p>
<p class="text-grey mb-10">IF THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER IS LIMITED, VOIDED, OR FOUND UNENFORCEABLE, THEN, UNLESS THE PARTIES MUTUALLY AGREE OTHERWISE, THE PARTIES’ AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE SHALL BE NULL AND VOID WITH RESPECT TO SUCH PROCEEDING SO LONG AS THE PROCEEDING IS PERMITTED TO PROCEED AS A CLASS ACTION.   If a court decides that the limitations of this paragraph are deemed invalid or unenforceable, any putative class, private attorney general, or consolidated or representative action must be brought in a court of proper jurisdiction and not in arbitration.<br>
<!-- -->Additional Provisions</p>
<p class="text-grey mb-10">8.1. Updating These Terms. We may modify these Terms from time to time in which case we will update the “Last Revised” date at the top of these Terms.  If we make changes that are material, we will use reasonable efforts to attempt to notify you, such as by e-mail and/or by placing a prominent notice on the first page of the Websites. However, it is your sole responsibility to review these Terms from time to time to view any such changes.  The updated Terms will be effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the updated Terms. Your continued access or use of the Services after the modifications have become effective will be deemed your acceptance of the modified Terms. No amendment shall apply to a dispute for which an arbitration has been initiated prior to the change in Terms.</p>
<p class="text-grey mb-10">8.2. Suspension; Termination. If you breach any of the provisions of these Terms, all licenses granted by the Organization will terminate automatically. Additionally, the Organization may, in its sole discretion, suspend or terminate your access to or use of any of the Services, with or without notice, for any or no reason, including, without limitation, (i) if we believe, in our sole discretion, you have engaged in any of the prohibited activities set forth in Section 3.2; (ii) if you provide any incomplete, incorrect or false information to us; (iii) if you have breached any portion of these Terms; and/or (iv) if we determine such action is necessary to comply with these Terms, any of our policies, procedures or practices, or any law rule or regulation.  All sections which by their nature should survive the termination of these Terms shall continue in full force and effect subsequent to and notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement by the Organization or you. Termination will not limit any of the Organization’s other rights or remedies at law or in equity.</p>
<p class="text-grey mb-10">8.3. Injunctive Relief. You agree that a breach of these Terms will cause irreparable injury to the Organization for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and the Organization shall be entitled to equitable relief in addition to any remedies it may have hereunder or at law without a bond, other security or proof of damages.</p>
<p class="text-grey mb-10">8.4. California Residents. If you are a California resident, in accordance with Cal. Civ. Code § 1789.3, you may report complaints to the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by contacting them in writing at 1625 North Market Blvd., Suite N 112 Sacramento, CA 95834, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210.</p>
<p class="text-grey mb-10">8.5. Export Laws. You agree that you will not export or re-export, directly or indirectly, the Services and/or other information or materials provided by the Organization hereunder, to any country for which the United States or any other relevant jurisdiction requires any export license or other governmental approval at the time of export without first obtaining such license or approval. In particular, but without limitation, the Services may not be exported or re-exported (a) into any U.S. embargoed countries or any country that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country, or (b) to anyone listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties, including the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Department of Commerce Denied Person’s List or Entity List. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you are not located in any such country or on any such list. You are responsible for and hereby agree to comply at your sole expense with all applicable United States export laws and regulations.</p>
<p class="text-grey mb-10">8.6. Force Majeure. We will not be liable or responsible to you, nor be deemed to have defaulted under or breached these Terms, for any failure or delay in fulfilling or performing any of our obligations under these Terms or in providing the Services, when and to the extent such failure or delay is caused by or results from any events beyond our ability to control, including acts of God; flood, fire, earthquake, epidemics, pandemics, tsunami, explosion, war, invasion, hostilities (whether war is declared or not), terrorist threats or acts, riot or other civil unrest, government order, law, or action, embargoes or blockades, strikes, labor stoppages or slowdowns or other industrial disturbances, shortage of adequate or suitable Internet connectivity, telecommunication breakdown or shortage of adequate power or electricity, and other similar events beyond our control.</p>
<p class="text-grey mb-10">8.7. Miscellaneous. If any provision of these Terms shall be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. These Terms and the licenses granted hereunder may be assigned by the Organization but may not be assigned by you without the prior express written consent of the Organization. No waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. The section headings used herein are for reference only and shall not be read to have any legal effect. The Services are operated by us in the United States. Those who choose to access the Services from locations outside the United States do so at their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws. These Terms are governed by the laws of the Cayman Islands, without regard to conflict of laws rules, and the proper venue for any disputes arising out of or relating to any of the same will be the state and federal courts located in the Cayman Islands.</p>

After the informal dispute resolution process, any remaining dispute, controversy, or claim (collectively, “Claim”) relating in any way to the Services and any usage of the Protocol, will be resolved by arbitration, including threshold questions of arbitrability of the Claim. You and the Organization agree that any Claim will be settled by final and binding arbitration, using the English language, administered by JAMS under its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “JAMS Rules”) then in effect (those rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this section, and as of the date of these Terms).  Because your contract with the Organization, these Terms, and this Arbitration Agreement concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the arbitrability of all disputes. However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit. Arbitration will be handled by a sole arbitrator in accordance with the JAMS Rules. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court that has jurisdiction. Any arbitration under these Terms will take place on an individual basis – class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. You understand that by agreeing to these Terms, you and the Organization are each waiving the right to trial by jury or to participate in a class action or class arbitration.1c:T4d4,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"7.7. WAIVER OF RIGHT TO BRING CLASS ACTION AND REPRESENTATIVE CLAIMS**.** To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you and the Organization each agree that any proceeding to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy will be brought and conducted ONLY IN THE RESPECTIVE PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS PART OF ANY CLASS (OR PURPORTED CLASS), CONSOLIDATED, MULTIPLE-PLAINTIFF, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING (“CLASS ACTION”).  You and the Organization AGREE TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS ACTION.  You and the Organization EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY ABILITY TO MAINTAIN A CLASS ACTION IN ANY FORUM.  If the dispute is subject to arbitration, THE ARBITRATOR WILL NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO COMBINE OR AGGREGATE CLAIMS, CONDUCT A CLASS ACTION, OR MAKE AN AWARD TO ANY PERSON OR ENTITY NOT A PARTY TO THE ARBITRATION.  Further, you and the Organization agree that the ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS FOR MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, AND IT MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CLASS ACTION.  For the avoidance of doubt, however, you can seek public injunctive relief to the extent authorized by law and consistent with the Exceptions clause above.1d:T43c,8.2. Suspension; Termination. If you breach any of the provisions of these Terms, all licenses granted by the Organization will terminate automatically. Additionally, the Organization may, in its sole discretion, suspend or terminate your access to or use of any of the Services, with or without notice, for any or no reason, including, without limitation, (i) if we believe, in our sole discretion, you have engaged in any of the prohibited activities set forth in Section 3.2; (ii) if you provide any incomplete, incorrect or false information to us; (iii) if you have breached any portion of these Terms; and/or (iv) if we determine such action is necessary to comply with these Terms, any of our policies, procedures or practices, or any law rule or regulation.

Termination will not limit any of the Organization’s other rights or remedies at law or in equity.1e:T45a,8.5. Export Laws. You agree that you will not export or re-export, directly or indirectly, the Services and/or other information or materials provided by the Organization hereunder, to any country for which the United States or any other relevant jurisdiction requires any export license or other governmental approval at the time of export without first obtaining such license or approval. In particular, but without limitation, the Services may not be exported or re-exported (a) into any U.S. embargoed countries or any country that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country, or (b) to anyone listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties, including the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Department of Commerce Denied Person’s List or Entity List. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you are not located in any such country or on any such list. You are responsible for and hereby agree to comply at your sole expense with all applicable United States export laws and regulations.1f:T486,8.7. Miscellaneous. If any provision of these Terms shall be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. These Terms and the licenses granted hereunder may be assigned by the Organization but may not be assigned by you without the prior express written consent of the Organization. No waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default.
