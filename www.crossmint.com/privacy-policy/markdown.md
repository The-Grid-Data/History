transactions will be accessible to third parties due to the nature of the
blockchain. We may share your personal information with the following
categories of third parties and as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy
or at the time of collection:

**â**

**Affiliates.**  Our corporate parent, subsidiaries, and affiliates, for
purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.

**_  
_Project Creators.** We may share your Contact data with the project
creator(s) of any NFTs you purchase through the Service, strictly to the
extent necessary to provide the Service and execute the intended transaction
initiated by you.

**â**

**Service providers.** We may share your personal information with our third-
party service providers that provide services on our behalf or help us operate
the Service or our business. This includes service providers that provide us
with technology support, hosting, payment processing (including financial
institutions with which we partner to process payments you have authorized),
transaction monitoring, customer service, auditing, analytics, maintenance,
security or other related business purposes. We may use third-party
Application Program Interfaces (âAPIsâ) and Software Development Kits
(âSDKsâ) as part of the functionality of our Service.

Additionally, we may share your personal information with third party identity
verification services in order to prevent fraud. This allows us to confirm
your identity by comparing the information you provide us to public records
and other third-party databases. These service providers may create derivative
data based on your personal information that can be used in connection with
the provision of identity verification and fraud prevention services.

**â**

**Authorities and others.** We may release your information to law
enforcement, government authorities, and private parties, as we believe in
good faith to be necessary or appropriate for the compliance and protection
purposes described above (including an investigatory or enforcement action by
the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or any other U.S. authorized statutory body
related to the DPF).

**â**

**Business Transferees.** We may release your information to a third party if
we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our
stock or assets. If this occurs, you will be notified of any change to this
Privacy Policy, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal
information.

**â**

**Linked third-party services**. If you log into the Service with, or
otherwise link your Service account to, a social media or other third-party
service, we may share your personal information with that third-party service.
The third partyâs use of the shared information will be governed by its
privacy policy and the settings associated with your account with the third-
party service.

**â**

**Professional advisors.**   Professional advisors, such as lawyers, auditors,
bankers and insurers, where necessary in the course of the professional
services that they render to us.

**â**

Crossmint recognizes the importance of maintaining accountability for personal
data transferred to third parties. When transferring personal information to a
third party, we comply with the Notice and Choice Principles and enter into
contracts that ensure such data is processed only for limited and specified
purposes consistent with your consent. These contracts require the third-party
controller to provide the same level of protection as the DPF Principles and
to notify us if they can no longer meet this obligation.

Our commitment to these principles ensures that your data remains protected,
even when handled by third parties. A summary of the relevant privacy
provisions of our contracts with third-party processors is available upon
request.

**â**

  7. **International Data Transfers**

**â**

We are headquartered in the United States and may use service providers that
operate in other countries. To facilitate our global operations, we may
transfer, store, and process your personal information within our affiliates,
third-party partners, and service providers based throughout the world
(specifically, outside of the EEA, UK and Switzerland, in what is defined as
âthird country transfersâ under GDPR).

**â**

In cases where we intend to transfer personal data to third countries or
international organizations outside of the EEA, we put in place suitable
technical, organizational and contractual safeguards (including Standard
Contractual Clauses as approved by the European Commission), to ensure that
such transfer is carried out in compliance with applicable data protection
rules, except where the country to which the personal information is
transferred has already been determined by the European Commission to provide
an adequate level of protection.

**â**

We also rely on decisions from the European Commission where they recognize
that certain countries and territories outside of the European Economic Area
ensure an adequate level of protection for personal information (âadequacy
decisionsâ), and we have adhered to the DPF Program Principles.

**â**

  8. **Your Privacy Choices**

**â**

**Access or update your information.** If you have registered for an account
with us through the Service, you may review and update certain account
information by contacting us.

**Opt-out of marketing communications**.  You will receive transaction-related
emails regarding the Service you have requested. We may also send you certain
non-promotional communications regarding us and our Service and you will not
be able to opt out of those communications (e.g., communications regarding the
Service or updates to our Terms of Service or this Privacy Policy).

You may opt-out of marketing-related emails by following the opt-out or
unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of the email, or by contacting us.
Please note that if you choose to opt-out of marketing-related emails, you may
continue to receive service-related and other non-marketing emails pursuant to
your use of the Service.

**â**

**Cookies and similar technologies.** You may stop or restrict the placement
of cookies and web beacons on your device or remove them by adjusting your
preferences as your browser or device permits.

respond to âDo Not Trackâ or similar signals. To find out more about âDo
Not Track,â please visit <http://www.allaboutdnt.com>.

**â**

**Linked third-party platforms**. If you choose to connect to the Service
through your social media account or other third-party platform, you may be
able to use your settings in your account with that platform to limit the
information we receive from it. If you revoke our ability to access
information from a third-party platform, that choice will not apply to
information that we have already received from that third party.

**â**

  9. **Data Retention**

**â**

We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the
purposes for which we collected it to provide the Service, including for the
purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting obligations or to
resolve disputes, or as otherwise communicated to you.

Moreover, our adherence to the DPF Principles will continue for as long as we
retain any personal data that was collected or processed under the DPF. Should
we ever decide to leave the DPF program, we will continue to apply the
Principles to such data or provide adequate protection by other means
recognized by applicable law. If we engage in an onward transfer of personal
data to third parties, we will remain liable under the DPF Principles if the
third party processes such data in a manner inconsistent with the Principles,
unless we prove that we were not responsible for the event giving rise to the
damage.

**â**

  10. **Information Security**

**â**

We take steps to secure your information in accordance with this Privacy
Policy. We have technical and administrative safeguards to protect the
security and confidentiality of your personal information. Unfortunately, no
system is 100% secure when transmitting and storing data, and we cannot ensure
or warrant the security of any information you provide to us.

**â**

By using the Service or providing personal information to us, you agree that
we may communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and
administrative issues relating to your use of the Service. If we learn of a
breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically by posting a notice on the

The Service is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 18 and we do

the age of 18. If a user submitting personal information is suspected of being
younger than 18 years of age, we will require the user to close his or her
account and will not allow the user to continue using our Service. We will
also comply with applicable legal requirements and take steps to delete the
information as soon as possible. Please notify us if you know of any
individuals under the age of 18 using our Service so we can take action to
prevent access to our Service.

**â**
