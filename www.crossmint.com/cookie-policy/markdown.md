# Cookie Policy

## Crossmint's Full Guide to Cookie Policy

**Last updated: January 4, 2023**

â

**Introduction**

â

Paella Inc., d/b/a Crossmint (â**Crossmint** ,â â**we** ,â â**us**
â or â**our** â) provides a platform that enables users to maintain a
digital custodial wallet that manages access to digital assets on the
blockchain and integrates with decentralized applications provided by third
parties.

â

This Cookie Policy explains how we use cookies and similar technologies when
you visit our websites located at crossmint.io, or any other websites, pages,
features, or content we own or operate (collectively, the "**Site(s)** ")
and/or when you interact with our online advertisements or marketing emails
(collectively the "**Services** "). It explains what these technologies are
and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.

â

In some cases, we may use cookies and similar technologies to collect personal
information, or information that becomes personal information if we combine it
with other information. The [Crossmint Privacy
Policy](https://crossmint.io/privacy-policy) (https://crossmint.io/privacy-
policy) will apply in addition to this Cookie Policy.

â

**1\. Acceptance of this Cookie Policy**

â

By accessing and using our Service, you accept the terms of this Cookie
Policy. If

you do not agree with or you are not comfortable with any aspect of this
Cookie

Policy, you should discontinue access or use of our Service.

â

### **2\. What are Cookies**

â

Cookies, which are small text files that websites store on user devices and
that allow web servers to record usersâ web browsing activities and remember
their submissions, preferences, and login status as they navigate a site.
Cookies used on our sites include both âsession cookiesâ that are deleted
when a session ends, âpersistent cookiesâ that remain longer, âfirst
partyâ cookies that we place and âthird partyâ cookies that our third-
party business partners and service providers place.

â

More information on cookies and their use can be found at www.aboutcookies.org
or www.allaboutcookies.org.

â

### **3\. Why We Use Cookies**

â

When you access our Sites and Services, we or companies we work with may place
cookies on your computer or other device. These technologies help us better
understand user behavior, and inform us about which parts of our websites
people have visited.

â

We use first party and third party cookies to recognize you as a Crossmint
customer, customize Services, content, and advertising, to measure promotional
effectiveness, and to collect information about your computer or other access
device to mitigate risk, help prevent fraud, and promote trust and safety.

â

We may place cookies from third-party service providers who may use
information about your visits to other websites to target advertisements for
products and services available from Crossmint. We do not control the types of
information collected and stored by these third-party cookies. You should
check the third-party's website for more information on how they use cookies.

â

Please refer to our [Privacy Policy](https://crossmint.io/privacy-policy)
(<https://crossmint.io/privacy-policy>) to understand how we collect and use
your information.

â

### **4\. What Types of Cookies Do We Use**

â

### We use the following types of cookies:

â

  * **Strictly necessary cookies.** Strictly necessary cookies allow core website functionality such as user login and account management. The website cannot be used properly without strictly necessary cookies.
  * **Unclassified cookies.** Unclassified cookies are cookies that do not belong to any other category or are in the process of categorization.
  * **Performance cookies.** Performance cookies are used to see how visitors use the website, eg. analytics cookies. Those cookies cannot be used to directly identify a certain visitor.
  * **Targeting cookies.** Targeting cookies are used to identify visitors between different websites, eg. content partners, banner networks. Those cookies may be used by companies to build a profile of visitor interests or show relevant ads on other websites.
  * **Functionality cookies.** Functionality cookies are used to remember visitor information on the website, eg. language, timezone, enhanced content.

â

### **5\. How Long will Cookies Stay On Your Device**

â

The length of time a cookie will stay on your browsing device depends on
whether it is a "persistent" or "session" cookie. Session cookies will only
stay on your device until you close your browser. Persistent cookies stay on
your browsing device until they expire or are deleted.

â

### **6\. Other Similar Technologies**

â

We, as well as third parties that provide content, or other functionality on
the Service, may use cookies, local storage, and other technologies to
automatically collect information through the Service.

â

  * **Local storage technologies** , like HTML5, that provide cookie-equivalent functionality but can store larger amounts of data on your device outside of your browser in connection with specific applications.
  * **Web beacons** , also known as pixel tags or clear GIFs, which are used to demonstrate that a webpage or email address was accessed or opened, or that certain content was viewed or clicked.

â

### **7\. How to Manage Cookies and Similar Technologies**

â

You have the right to decide whether to accept cookies. You can exercise your
preferences in relation to cookies served on our Sites by taking the steps
outlined below.

â

Cookies. You can enable or disable categories of cookies by visiting our
Cookie Consent Manager. This includes both first party and third party
cookies. You can also use the browser with which you are viewing this website
to enable, disable or delete cookies. To do this, follow the instructions
provided by your browser (usually located within the "Help", "Tools" or "Edit"
settings), or review the instructions provided by the browsers listed here:
[Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-
us/help/260971/description-of-cookies), [Google
Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en-GB), [Mozilla
Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/cookies-information-websites-
store-on-your-computer), [Safari
Desktop](https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/manage-cookies-and-website-
data-sfri11471/mac), [Safari Mobile](https://support.apple.com/en-
us/HT201265), and [Android
browser](https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/54068?visit_id=637284515772371005-3491757126&hl=en&rd=1).

â

Please note, if you set your browser to disable cookies, you may not be able
to access secure areas of the Sites and Services. Also, if you disable cookies
other parts of the Services may not work properly. You can find more
information about how to change your browser cookie settings at
[_http://www.allaboutcookies.org_](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

There are also additional tools available to manage third party cookies. Many
advertising companies that collect information for interest-based advertising
are members of the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) or the Network
Advertising Initiative (NAI), both of which maintain websites where
individuals can opt out of interest-based advertising from their members. To
opt-out of website interest-based advertising provided by each
organizationâs respective participating companies, visit the DAAâs opt-out
portal available at <http://optout.aboutads.info/>, the DAA of Canadaâs opt-
out portal available at <https://youradchoices.ca/en/tools>, or visit the
NAIâs opt-out portal available at
<http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1>. Residents of the European Union
may opt-out of online behavioral advertising served by the European
Interactive Digital Advertising Allianceâs participating member
organizations by visiting <https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/>.

â

Mobile Advertising: You can opt out of having your mobile advertising
identifiers used for certain types of advertising by accessing the appropriate
settings in your mobile device and following the instructions. If you opt-out,
we will remove all data about you and will not collect any further data. The
random ID previously assigned to you will be removed. Thus, if at a later
stage, you decide to opt-in, we will be unable to continue and track you using
the prior ID and you will for all practical purposes be a new user. For iOS
devices, to limit interest-based ad tracking, go to Settings > Privacy >
Advertising > Turn on âLimit Ad Tracking.â For Android devices, go to
Settings > Google services > Ads > Turn on âOpt out of Ads Personalization."
For iOS and Android, you can also reset the advertising identifier that is
currently assigned to you.

â

Do Not Track: Some Internet browsers - like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and
Safari - include the ability to transmit "Do Not Track" or "DNT" signals.
Since uniform standards for "DNT" signals have not been adopted, our Sites do
not currently process or respond to "DNT" signals.

â

Flash Cookies. If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you
can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash Cookies storage
using the tools contained in the website storage settings panel, available
here:
<http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html>.
You can also control Flash Cookies by going to the global storage settings
panel and following the instructions. Setting the Flash Player to restrict or
limit acceptance of Flash Cookies may reduce or impede the functionality of
some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in
connection with our services or online content.

â

**8\. Changes to our Privacy Policy**

â

We may, in our sole discretion, change this Cookie Policy from time to time by
posting a revised version at www.crossmint.com/cookie-policy. If we make any
material change to this Cookie Policy, we will notify you by posting a notice
on www.crossmint.com/privacy prior to the change becoming effective and may
also elect to send you an email notifying you of the cookie modifications. Any
modifications to this Cookie Policy will be effective upon our posting the
modified version (or as otherwise indicated at the time of posting). In all
cases, your use of the Service after the effective date of any modified Cookie
Policy indicates your acceptance of the modified Cookie Policy.
