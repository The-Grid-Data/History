You are responsible for keeping all information for your Payment Method updated and accurate through the term of this Agreement.<strong><br><br></strong>Users who have registered for an Account (each, a â<strong>Registered User</strong>â) and have provided a valid Payment Method to Crossmint can use the Payment Method to purchase an NFT being offered for sale by Crossmint or by an Original Offeror, including without limitation (i) an Original Offeror that has integrated the Service into its platform; and (ii) an Original Offeror offering an NFT that they own for sale through a third-party platform that has integrated the Service into its platform. All pricing for such NFTs is set by the seller of such NFTs and listed at point of sale or otherwise through the platform on which such seller makes such NFTs available for purchase. <strong><br><br></strong>When you use the Service to purchase an NFT offered for sale by an Original Offeror, you agree and understand that Crossmint will (i) purchase such NFT and take custody of such NFT, and (ii) settle the Transaction with you by charging or debiting your chosen payment method and delivering to your Crossmint Wallet the NFT you have purchased from Crossmint. Once Crossmint completes the purchase of the NFT from the Original Offeror, Crossmint settles with the Original Offeror via payment in cryptocurrency or fiat currency, as applicable. &nbsp;<strong><br><br></strong>Crossmint will facilitate the transfer of any NFT you purchase using the Service to your Crossmint Wallet as soon as funds have settled to Crossmint, or earlier in Crossmintâs sole discretion. This settlement of funds to Crossmint, and in turn the transfer of the NFT from Crossmint to your Crossmint Wallet, may take up to three business days but in some cases may be longer. Crossmint is not responsible for any delays related to such transfer and/or any damage this may cause you, if any. Crossmint may also require you to provide additional information and documents in connection with a Transaction where it has reasons to believe that: (i) your Account is being used for money laundering or for any other illegal activity; (ii) you have concealed or reported false identification information and other details; or (iii) Transactions effected via your Account in breach of this Agreement. In such cases, Crossmint, in its sole discretion, may pause or cancel such Transaction until such requested additional information and documents have been reviewed by Crossmint and accepted as satisfying the requirements of applicable law, regulation, or policy. If you do not provide complete and accurate information and documents in response to such a request, or Crossmint is otherwise unable to verify your identity, Crossmint may, in its sole discretion, (A) reverse or rescind any NFT purchase Transaction that it reasonably suspects has been conducted in violation of applicable law or this Agreement; and/or (B) refuse to provide any NFT, Content, product, service and/or further access to the Service to you.<strong><br><br></strong>If Crossmint cannot complete your Transaction for any reason (including price movement, market latency, or order size), Crossmint will reject the order and notify you of such rejection. In the event a Transaction cannot be completed, (i) If your card has not been charged, Crossmint will authorize a release of any hold on your card in connection with a rejected order; and (ii) if your card has already been charged, Crossmint will initiate a refund to your card. You will not be irrevocably charged for a rejected Transaction unless it is due to your breach of this Agreement or agreement with the provider of your Payment Method, or otherwise. <strong><br><br></strong>By purchasing an NFT through the Service, you expressly acknowledge and agree that THE PURCHASE OF AN NFT IS FINAL, NON-REFUNDABLE, AND NON-REVERSIBLE. You further acknowledge and agree that the contractual services, including the immediate provisioning and delivery of the purchased NFT to your Crossmint Wallet, will commence immediately upon completion of the purchase Transaction. By accepting these terms and engaging in a Transaction, you expressly waive any right of withdrawal or right to cancel the purchase under any applicable distance selling or consumer protection laws, regulations, or directives, including but not limited to those within the European Union. You understand that this waiver is necessary to facilitate the unique nature of NFT transactions and that once the NFT is transferred to your Crossmint Wallet, it cannot be returned or exchanged. You are encouraged to carefully consider your purchase and consult with legal or financial advisors as necessary before committing to a Transaction.<strong><br><br></strong>When you choose to purchase an NFT through the Service using a cryptocurrency, we will request the applicable cryptocurrency funds from your wallet before we buy the NFT. If Crossmintâs buying transaction fails, and you are entitled to a refund as addressed in the immediately preceding paragraph, you acknowledge and agree that (i) you may be liable for gas fees and other transaction costs in connection with such refund; and (ii) at our sole discretion, we may provide such refund in an equivalent value in a different cryptocurrency from the one in which you originally funded the purchase.<strong><br><br></strong>In the event that you are entitled to a refund in connection with a cryptocurrency purchase of an NFT, you will be asked to enter a valid third-party digital wallet address through the Service. You represent and warrant that you are the owner of the wallet that you provide. You are solely responsible for ensuring that the wallet address is correct and that the wallet supports the cryptocurrency in which the refund will be processed. All such refund payments are non-cancellable and irreversible.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>â</strong></p><ol start="7" role="list"><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Your Crossmint Wallet</strong></li></ol><p><strong>â</strong></p><p>Your Crossmint Wallet is linked to your Account and may include multiple discrete digital wallets, each supporting a different blockchain, but collectively visible to you through the Service as a single digital wallet. Once an NFT is transferred to your Crossmint Wallet, you can log into your Account on the Site to access, view, and display through such Crossmint Wallet NFTs that (i) you have purchased using the Service; or (ii) you have purchased outside the Service and transferred to such Crossmint Wallet. Crossmint does not represent that your Crossmint Wallet or any NFTs stored therein will be interoperable with any specific third-party platform or service, or that you will be able to access and/or redeem any benefits embedded in or otherwise connected to an NFT (such as, for example, token-gated access to a third-party service) while such NFT is in your Crossmint Wallet.</p><p>If you wish to withdraw an NFT from your Crossmint Wallet to a third-party digital wallet, you must submit a request to Crossmint. Crossmint will make commercially reasonable efforts to effect all such withdrawals within a reasonable period of time. You may be liable for gas fees and other transaction costs in connection with such withdrawal. &nbsp;Crossmint shall have no liability to you in connection with any loss or error arising from or in connection with any incorrect information (including, for e.g., third-party digital wallet address) provided by you in connection with any such withdrawal.</p><p>Except for what is set forth in section 7.1 below regarding Crossmint Non-Custodial Wallet, your Crossmint Wallet cannot store fungible tokens, and thus you cannot deposit fungible tokens in your Crossmint Wallet.

In contrast to the custodial services provided for NFTs, the Non-Custodial Wallet is designed to ensure that you have exclusive control over your private keys, mnemonic phrases, PIN and any other applicable access credentials that may be in force from time to time.<br><br>When you create your Non-Custodial Wallet with Crossmint, a private key is uniquely assigned to you.

You hold sole responsibility for the preservation and security of your private key and any mnemonic phrase, PIN and any other applicable access credentials connected to your Non-Custodial Wallet. It is imperative that you maintain the security of your wallet address and your private key information, as well as any applicable access credentials. &nbsp;<br><br>It is of paramount importance that you backup your private keys and related access credentials diligently. Any failure in doing so may culminate in the loss of control over the digital assets associated with your Non-Custodial Wallet. You acknowledge and agree that Crossmint does not receive or store, and cannot access, your wallet password, encrypted private key, unencrypted private key, mnemonic phrase or PIN, as the case may be, linked to your Non-Custodial Wallet. Crossmint is unable to generate a new password for your Non-Custodial Wallet if you forget your original password. If you&nbsp; lose access to the private key or other access credential for your Non-Custodial Wallet, you accept and acknowledge that any digital assets associated with such wallet address will become irreversibly inaccessible. In light of this, Crossmint shall bear no responsibility or liability whatsoever in the event you are unable to access your Non-Custodial Wallet for any reason, including but not limited to your failure to secure your wallet address, wallet password, encrypted private key, unencrypted private key, mnemonic phrase or PIN, as the case may be.<br><br>Upon the creation of a Non-Custodial Wallet, we strongly encourage you to employ robust security measures to prevent the loss of access to, and control over, your wallet. Recommended security measures include, but are not limited to:<br><br>Establishing a robust, unique password that is not utilized for any other service or purpose, and employing biometric authentication if accessible.<br><br>Refraining from storing your private key and seed phrase in unencrypted formats online or in unsecured physical locations.<br><br>Restricting access to your devices and your Non-Custodial Wallet.<br><br>Implementing comprehensive precautions against potential malware on your devices and networks.<br><br>Keeping your wallet software up-to-date to maintain the security and functionality of your Non-Custodial Wallet.</li></ul><ul role="list"><li>7.1.3. <strong>Limitation of Liability for Non-Custodial Wallets</strong>.&nbsp; The following limitations of liability of Crossmint apply to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law, and all such limitations of liability of Crossmint shall be cumulative:<br><br>a. Loss of Access Credentials: Crossmint shall not be responsible or liable for any loss, damage, or inconvenience suffered by you due to the loss, disclosure, or unauthorized use of private keys, seed phrases, or other access credentials related to the Non-Custodial Wallet.<br><br>b. Transaction Errors: You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of transaction details, including recipient addresses and transaction amounts. Crossmint shall not be liable for any errors, losses, or damages resulting from incorrect transaction details provided by users.<br><br>c. Third-Party Access: Crossmint is not responsible for unauthorized access to the Non-Custodial Wallet resulting from your actions or omissions, including sharing access credentials or failing to secure your private keys, wallet password, mnemonic phrase or PIN, as the case may be.<br><br>d. Additional Disclaimer: Crossmint is not liable for any loss or damage, or other unauthorized access to Non-Custodial Wallets, resulting, directly or indirectly, from your actions or inactions, or other negligence, willful misconduct or fraud.</li></ul><p>â</p><ol start="8" role="list"><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Pricing; Payment</strong></li></ol><p><strong>â</strong></p><p>Any payment obligations you incur are binding at the time of purchase.

Our fee may include gas fees to process a Transaction, which we will calculate in our discretion, as well as the gas fees for the eventual export of the NFT out of the Crossmint Wallet in the future. We will notify you of the total amount of your purchase at or before the time you authorize the Transaction. You are responsible for paying any additional fees charged by your financial services provider. In the event that we receive a payment in an amount less than the total due for the relevant Transaction, we will reject the order, notify you of the reason for the rejection, and (except where otherwise required to comply with applicable law) return the payment less our processing costs. You may be responsible for additional transaction fees, including gas fees, in connection with your Transaction. </p><p>When a Transaction is initiated through your Account, we will assume that you authorized such Transaction, unless you notify us otherwise.

It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</p><p>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. You agree that any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of the Service, to any products sold or distributed through the Service, to any NFTs, or to any aspect of your relationship with Crossmint, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (i) you may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if your claims qualify; and (ii) you or Crossmint may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all disputes or claims and requests for relief that arose or were asserted before the effective date of this Agreement or any prior version of this Agreement. &nbsp;</p><p>Arbitration Rules and Forum. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your dispute or claim or request for relief to us at support@Crossmint.io. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving claims, counterclaims, or request for relief under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneysâ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMSâs most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/; all other disputes shall be subject to JAMSâs most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/. JAMSâs rules are also available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMSâs filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, Crossmint will pay them for you. In addition, we will reimburse all such JAMSâs filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for disputes, claims, or requests for relief totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. </p><p>Authority of Arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (i) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement and (ii) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to, any assertion that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and us. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forumâs rules, and this Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us. &nbsp;</p><p>Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND CROSSMINT HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and we are instead electing that all disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 17.a (Application of Arbitration Agreement) above. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review. </p><p>Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief. ALL DISPUTES, CLAIMS, AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this sectionâs limitations as to a given dispute, claim, or request for relief, then such aspect must be severed from the arbitration and brought into the State or Federal Courts located in the State of New York. All other disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be arbitrated. </p><p>30-Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to support@crossmint.io within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, your username (if any), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us. </p><p>Severability. Except as provided in Section 17.e (Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief), if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. Survival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with us. </p><p>Modification. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if we make any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, you may reject that change within thirty (30) days of such change becoming effective by writing us at support@crossmint.io and expressly opting out of this Arbitration Agreement.</p><p>EU Users.
