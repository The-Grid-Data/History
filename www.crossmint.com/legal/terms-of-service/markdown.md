# Terms of Service

## Crossmint's Full Guide to Terms of Service

**Last updated: November 14, 2023**

**â**

  1. **Introduction**

**â**

This End User Terms of Service Agreement (this â**Agreement** â) governs
your access to and use of certain products, services and properties made
available by Paella Inc., d/b/a Crossmint (â**Crossmint** ,â âwe,â
âusâ or âourâ), a Delaware corporation, with offices at 1317 Edgewater
Dr #4296, Orlando, FL 32804. Our products, services and properties include,
without limitation, our website available at
[www.crossmint.com](http://www.crossmint.com/) (the â**Site** â), our
services to facilitate the purchase, storage, and transfer of certain non-
fungible tokens (â**NFT(s)** â), and software provided on or in connection
with those services (collectively, the â**Service** â). Certain features
of the Service may be subject to additional guidelines, terms, or rules
(â**Supplemental Terms** â), which will be displayed in connection with
such features. All such Supplemental Terms are incorporated by reference into
this Agreement. If this Agreement are inconsistent with any Supplemental
Terms, the Supplemental Terms shall control solely with respect to such
services. **  
  
**CROSSMINT IS NOT A BROKER, FINANCIAL INSTITUTION OR CREDITOR. CROSSMINT
FACILITATES TRANSACTIONS OF NFTS ON BEHALF OF USERS IN CONNECTION WITH THE
PURCHASE, STORAGE, AND SALE OF SUCH NFTS. YOU SPECIFICALLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND
AGREE THAT, IF YOU USE THE SERVICE TO PURCHASE AN NFT, THE PLATFORM OR THIRD-
PARTY SELLER ORIGINALLY OFFERING SUCH NFT (THE â**ORIGINAL OFFEROR** â)
SHALL BE AN INTENDED THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO
ANY SUCH PURCHASE. YOU AGREE THAT CROSSMINT SHALL NOT BE A PARTY TO OR HAVE
ANY RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR, ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO, ASSOCIATED
WITH OR RESULTING FROM ANY DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND ANY ORIGINAL OFFEROR OF AN
NFT IN RESPECT OF SUCH NFT OR SUCH NFT BEING CONSIDERED AN INVESTMENT CONTRACT
OR ANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR OTHER RIGHTS EMBODIED THEREBY OR INCLUDED
THEREWITH. **  
  
**YOU BEAR FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR VERIFYING THE IDENTITY, LEGITIMACY, AND
AUTHENTICITY OF NFTS YOU PURCHASE THROUGH THE SERVICE OR ANY CLAIMS MADE BY
ANY ORIGINAL OFFEROR OF SUCH NFTS. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING SET FORTH HEREIN
OR THROUGH THE SERVICE, CROSSMINT MAKES NO CLAIMS ABOUT THE IDENTITY,
LEGITIMACY, OR AUTHENTICITY OF NFTS THAT YOU MAY PURCHASE THROUGH THE SERVICE,
OR ANY CLAIMS MADE BY ANY ORIGINAL OFFEROR OF SUCH NFTS.

PLEASE READ SECTION 17 OF THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY, AS IT CONTAINS AN
ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WHICH WILL, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, REQUIRE DISPUTES
BETWEEN US TO BE SUBMITTED TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION. UNLESS YOU OPT
OUT OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT: (1) YOU WILL ONLY BE PERMITTED TO PURSUE
CLAIMS AND SEEK RELIEF AGAINST US ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, NOT AS A PLAINTIFF
OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING; AND (2)
YOU ARE AGREEING TO MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION FOR THE RESOLUTION OF
DISPUTES AND WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL ON YOUR CLAIMS.

**â**

PLEASE BE AWARE THAT SECTION 3 OF THIS AGREEMENT, BELOW, CONTAINS YOUR OPT-IN
CONSENT TO RECEIVE COMMUNICATIONS FROM US.

**â**

THIS AGREEMENT IS IMPORTANT AND AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, SO PLEASE READ IT
CAREFULLY. BY CLICKING ON ANY âI ACCEPTâ BUTTON, COMPLETING THE ACCOUNT
REGISTRATION PROCESS, PURCHASING ITEMS THROUGH THE SERVICE, AND/OR OTHERWISE
USING THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT AND ALL OF THE
TERMS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. If you do not agree to this Agreement,
you may not access or use the Service or purchase any NFTs through the
Service. For existing users of the Service, you acknowledge and agree that
this Agreement is effective beginning on the date on which you first accessed
and/or used any Service.

By submitting data through the Service, you expressly consent to the
collection, use and disclosure of your personal data in accordance with this
Agreement and any then-current [Privacy
Policy](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jrZAiwZp8p2WQX30wG3F42iCB3dkhRpn/view)
made available by us.

Crossmint reserves the right to change or modify this Agreement at any time
and in our sole discretion. If we make changes to this Agreement, we will
provide notice of such changes, such as by sending an email notification,
providing notice through the Service or updating the âLast Updatedâ date
at the beginning of this Agreement. By continuing to access or use the Service
at any point after such update, you confirm your acceptance of the revised
Agreement and all of the terms incorporated therein by reference. We encourage
you to review this Agreement frequently to ensure that you understand the
terms and conditions that apply when you access or use the Service. If you do
not agree to the revised Agreement, you may not access or use the Service.

**â**

  2.      **Our service**

**â**

The Service is a software application made available by Crossmint that allows
Registered Users (as defined below) to (i) engage in transactions directly
with Crossmint or with an Original Offeror for the purchase of NFTs in
exchange for fiat currency and/or cryptocurrency, in each case in accordance
with the functionality of the Service (each such transaction, a
â**Transaction** â); and (ii) store and access such NFTs through one or
more digital wallets made available by Crossmint (each, a â**Crossmint
Wallet** â). Such Transactions may be facilitated through the Crossmint
website directly, or through a Crossmint plug-in or other integration on a
third-party platform.  
  
Crossmint may also make available to you a non-custodial wallet (each a
â**Non-Custodial-Wallet** â) for the storage of cryptocurrency and other
fungible tokens. In that case, your use of such Non-Custodial Wallet shall be
regulated separately by the terms set forth in Section 7.1 of this Agreement,
and you hereby acknowledge and accept that such terms apply to your access and
use of your Non-Custodial Wallet.  
  
You may only use certain portions of the Service by registering for an
Account, as defined below.

**â**

  3.      **Account Registration**     ** **      

**â**

In order to use certain features of the Service you will need to register for
an account on the Service (âAccountâ). You must be eighteen (18) years old
or otherwise capable of forming a binding contract to register for an Account.
By creating an Account, you agree to (i) provide accurate, current, and
complete Account information about yourself, (ii) maintain and promptly update
from time to time as necessary your Account information, (iii) maintain the
security of your password (and private keys if you are using a Non-Custodial
Wallet) and accept all risks of unauthorized access to your Account and the
information you provide to us, and (iv) immediately notify us if you discover
or otherwise suspect any security breaches related to the Service or your
Account. You may not have more than one Account, and Crossmint reserves the
right to block multiple Accounts of the same user. We reserve our right to
establish and conduct, at any time during the term of this Agreement, know-
your-customer (â**KYC** â) protocols in accordance with cryptocurrency
industryâs best practices regarding your use of the Service.  
  
You may sign into the Service with or otherwise link your Account to a valid
account that you hold through a compatible third-party service (â**Third-
Party Account** â) by allowing Crossmint to access your Third-Party Account,
as is permitted under the applicable terms and conditions that govern your use
of such Third-Party Account. You represent that you are entitled to disclose
your Third-Party Account login information to Crossmint and/or grant Crossmint
access to your Third-Party Account (including, but not limited to, for use for
the purposes described herein) without breach by you of any of the terms and
conditions that govern your use of the applicable Third-Party Account and
without obligating Crossmint to pay any fees or making Crossmint subject to
any usage limitations imposed by such third-party service providers. By
granting Crossmint access to any Third-Party Accounts, you understand that
Crossmint may access, make available and store (if applicable) any
information, data, text, software, messages, tags and/or other materials
accessible through the Service (collectively, â**Content** â) that you
have provided to and stored in your Third-Party Account, solely as permitted
by the functionality of the Service and your permission settings in such
Third-Party Account. Please note that if a Third-Party Account or associated
service becomes unavailable, or Crossmintâs access to such Third-Party
Account is terminated by the third-party service provider, then any Content
made available from or through such Third-Party Account may no longer be
available on and through Service. You may have the ability to disable the
connection between your Account and your Third-Party Accounts at any time by
accessing your settings within such Third-Party Account. PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR
THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT(S) WITH SUCH THIRD-
PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS, AND CROSSMINT DISCLAIMS ANY LIABILITY FOR PERSONALLY
IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION THAT MAY BE PROVIDED TO IT BY SUCH THIRD-PARTY
SERVICE PROVIDERS IN VIOLATION OF THE PRIVACY SETTINGS THAT YOU HAVE SET IN
SUCH THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS. Crossmint makes no effort to review any Content for
any purpose, including but not limited to, for accuracy, legality or
noninfringement, and Crossmint is not responsible for any Content.

You agree that you will not (i) buy, sell, rent, or lease access to your
Account without our written permission; (ii) register or attempt to register
for a new Account without our written permission after your Account has been
disabled or deleted by us; (iii) share your Account password with anyone; or
(iv) log in or try to log in to access the Service through unauthorized third
party applications or clients.

â

  4. **Know Your Client.**

**â**

When you register for your Account, you agree to provide Crossmint with any
information we request for the purposes of identity verification and the
detection of money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud or any other
financial crime and permit us to keep a record of such information. Crossmint
reserves the right to require you to provide additional information and
documents as it believes reasonably necessary, including at the request of any
competent authority or in order to assist Crossmint with complying with its
obligations under applicable law, regulation, or policy, including laws
related to anti-money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Crossmint may
also require you to provide additional information and documents in cases
where it has reason to believe that: (i) your Account is being used for money
laundering or for any other illegal activity; (ii) you have concealed or
reported false identification information and other details; or (iii)
Transactions effected via your Account were effected in breach of this
Agreement. In such cases, Crossmint, in its sole discretion, may pause or
cancel your Transactions until such requested additional information and
documents have been reviewed by Crossmint and accepted as satisfying the
requirements of applicable law, regulation, or policy.  
  
If you do not provide complete and accurate information and documents in
response to such a request, or Crossmint is otherwise unable to verify your
identity, or we have actual indications of fraud or violation of applicable
legislation or regulation from your side, Crossmint may, in its sole
discretion:

  1. suspend your account temporarily while we investigate further
  2. reverse or rescind any NFT purchase Transaction that it reasonably suspects has been conducted in violation of applicable law, fraud or this Agreement; 
  3. refuse to provide any NFT, Content, product, service and/or further access to the Service to you; and/or 
  4. if no other remedy is available and you have not complied with our requests to verify your compliance with applicable legislation, terminate your Account; 

all without no compensation whatsoever for you.

In the latter (iv) above (this is, if no other remedy is available and you
have not complied with our requests to verify your compliance with applicable
legislation, and, in response, we terminate your account), you hereby
acknowledge and accept that any NFT left behind in your Crossmint Wallet shall
be repossessed by Crossmint, and thus you hereby waive any right you may have
over such NFT(s) and any legal action to claim back ownership or any other
right over the abovementioned NFT(s).

     

  5. **Consent to Electronic Communication**

**â**

By creating an Account, you consent to receive electronic communications from
Crossmint (e.g., via email or by posting notices to the Service). These
communications may include notices about your Account (e.g., password changes
and other transactional information) and are part of your relationship with
us. You agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures or other
communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal
communication requirements, including, but not limited to, that such
communications be in writing. You should maintain copies of electronic
communications from us by printing a paper copy or saving an electronic copy.
We have no obligation to store for your later use or access any such
electronic communications that we make to you. We may also send you
promotional communications via email, including, but not limited to,
newsletters, special offers, surveys and other news and information we think
will be of interest to you. You may opt out of receiving these promotional
emails at any time by following the unsubscribe instructions provided therein.  
  
When you register for an Account, you hereby represent and warrant, to and for
the benefit of Crossmint, its affiliates and its and their respective
representatives, as follows:**  
  
**Accuracy of Personal Information. All information provided to Crossmint
and/or its third-party designees, including address and social security number
or tax ID number, is accurate and complete. None of: (i) you; (ii) any of your
affiliates; (iii) any other person having a beneficial interest in you; or
(iv) any person for whom you are acting as agent or nominee in connection with
this Agreement is: (A) a country, territory, entity or individual named on an
OFAC list as provided at http://www.treas.gov/ofac, or a person or entity
prohibited under the OFAC programs, regardless of whether or not they appear
on the OFAC list; or (B) a senior foreign political figure, or any immediate
family member or close associate of a senior foreign political figure; or (C)
a national or resident of any jurisdiction subject to a U.S. trade embargo.**  
  
**Independent Investigation and Non-Reliance. You are sophisticated,
experienced and knowledgeable in the buying, selling or trading of NFTs, as
applicable. Additionally, you have conducted an independent investigation of
the Service and the matters contemplated by this Agreement, have formed your
own independent judgment regarding the benefits and risks of and necessary and
desirable practices regarding the foregoing, and, in making the determination
to buy, sell or trade any NFTs using the Service, you have relied solely on
the results of such investigation and such independent judgement. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, you understand, acknowledge and
agree that the legal requirements pertaining to blockchain technologies and
digital assets and digital goods generally, including the NFTs, are uncertain,
and you have conducted an independent investigation of such potentially
applicable legal requirements and the resulting risks and uncertainties,
including the risk that one or more governmental entities or other persons may
assert that any digital assets or cryptographic tokens (including the NFTs)
may constitute securities under applicable legal requirements. You hereby
irrevocably disclaim and disavow reliance upon any statements or
representations made by or on behalf of, or information made available by,
Crossmint, in determining to enter into this Agreement or to buy, sell or
trade any NFTs or otherwise use the Service.**  
  
**Litigation. There is no legal proceeding pending that relates to your
activities relating to NFTs, other digital assets, or blockchain technology.

Compliance. You have not failed to comply with, and have not violated, any
applicable legal requirement relating to any blockchain technologies, token
trading activities or NFT purchase and/or sale. No investigation or review by
any governmental entity is pending or, to your knowledge, has been threatened
against or with respect to you, nor does any government order or action
prohibit you or any of your representatives from engaging in or continuing any
conduct, activity or practice relating to NFTs.

You must provide all equipment and software necessary to connect to the
Service. You are solely responsible for any fees, including Internet
connection or mobile fees, that you incur when accessing the Service.

**â**

  6.      **Purchasing an NFT**

**â**

In order to purchase an NFT using the Service, you must provide a valid and
accepted payment method, such as your credit card (your â**Payment Method**
â). Upon Crossmintâs authorization and verification of your Payment
Method(s), you will be able to engage in Transactions. You are responsible for
keeping all information for your Payment Method updated and accurate through
the term of this Agreement.**  
  
**Users who have registered for an Account (each, a â**Registered User**
â) and have provided a valid Payment Method to Crossmint can use the Payment
Method to purchase an NFT being offered for sale by Crossmint or by an
Original Offeror, including without limitation (i) an Original Offeror that
has integrated the Service into its platform; and (ii) an Original Offeror
offering an NFT that they own for sale through a third-party platform that has
integrated the Service into its platform. All pricing for such NFTs is set by
the seller of such NFTs and listed at point of sale or otherwise through the
platform on which such seller makes such NFTs available for purchase. **  
  
**When you use the Service to purchase an NFT offered for sale by an Original
Offeror, you agree and understand that Crossmint will (i) purchase such NFT
and take custody of such NFT, and (ii) settle the Transaction with you by
charging or debiting your chosen payment method and delivering to your
Crossmint Wallet the NFT you have purchased from Crossmint. Once Crossmint
completes the purchase of the NFT from the Original Offeror, Crossmint settles
with the Original Offeror via payment in cryptocurrency or fiat currency, as
applicable.  **  
  
**Crossmint will facilitate the transfer of any NFT you purchase using the
Service to your Crossmint Wallet as soon as funds have settled to Crossmint,
or earlier in Crossmintâs sole discretion. This settlement of funds to
Crossmint, and in turn the transfer of the NFT from Crossmint to your
Crossmint Wallet, may take up to three business days but in some cases may be
longer. Crossmint is not responsible for any delays related to such transfer
and/or any damage this may cause you, if any. Crossmint may also require you
to provide additional information and documents in connection with a
Transaction where it has reasons to believe that: (i) your Account is being
used for money laundering or for any other illegal activity; (ii) you have
concealed or reported false identification information and other details; or
(iii) Transactions effected via your Account in breach of this Agreement. In
such cases, Crossmint, in its sole discretion, may pause or cancel such
Transaction until such requested additional information and documents have
been reviewed by Crossmint and accepted as satisfying the requirements of
applicable law, regulation, or policy. If you do not provide complete and
accurate information and documents in response to such a request, or Crossmint
is otherwise unable to verify your identity, Crossmint may, in its sole
discretion, (A) reverse or rescind any NFT purchase Transaction that it
reasonably suspects has been conducted in violation of applicable law or this
Agreement; and/or (B) refuse to provide any NFT, Content, product, service
and/or further access to the Service to you.**  
  
**If Crossmint cannot complete your Transaction for any reason (including
price movement, market latency, or order size), Crossmint will reject the
order and notify you of such rejection. In the event a Transaction cannot be
completed, (i) If your card has not been charged, Crossmint will authorize a
release of any hold on your card in connection with a rejected order; and (ii)
if your card has already been charged, Crossmint will initiate a refund to
your card. You will not be irrevocably charged for a rejected Transaction
unless it is due to your breach of this Agreement or agreement with the
provider of your Payment Method, or otherwise.**  
  
**By purchasing an NFT through the Service, you expressly acknowledge and
agree that THE PURCHASE OF AN NFT IS FINAL, NON-REFUNDABLE, AND NON-
REVERSIBLE. You further acknowledge and agree that the contractual services,
including the immediate provisioning and delivery of the purchased NFT to your
Crossmint Wallet, will commence immediately upon completion of the purchase
Transaction. By accepting these terms and engaging in a Transaction, you
expressly waive any right of withdrawal or right to cancel the purchase under
any applicable distance selling or consumer protection laws, regulations, or
directives, including but not limited to those within the European Union. You
understand that this waiver is necessary to facilitate the unique nature of
NFT transactions and that once the NFT is transferred to your Crossmint
Wallet, it cannot be returned or exchanged. You are encouraged to carefully
consider your purchase and consult with legal or financial advisors as
necessary before committing to a Transaction.**  
  
**When you choose to purchase an NFT through the Service using a
cryptocurrency, we will request the applicable cryptocurrency funds from your
wallet before we buy the NFT. If Crossmintâs buying transaction fails, and
you are entitled to a refund as addressed in the immediately preceding
paragraph, you acknowledge and agree that (i) you may be liable for gas fees
and other transaction costs in connection with such refund; and (ii) at our
sole discretion, we may provide such refund in an equivalent value in a
different cryptocurrency from the one in which you originally funded the
purchase.**  
  
**In the event that you are entitled to a refund in connection with a
cryptocurrency purchase of an NFT, you will be asked to enter a valid third-
party digital wallet address through the Service. You represent and warrant
that you are the owner of the wallet that you provide. You are solely
responsible for ensuring that the wallet address is correct and that the
wallet supports the cryptocurrency in which the refund will be processed. All
such refund payments are non-cancellable and irreversible.  

**â**

  7.      **Your Crossmint Wallet**

**â**

Your Crossmint Wallet is linked to your Account and may include multiple
discrete digital wallets, each supporting a different blockchain, but
collectively visible to you through the Service as a single digital wallet.
Once an NFT is transferred to your Crossmint Wallet, you can log into your
Account on the Site to access, view, and display through such Crossmint Wallet
NFTs that (i) you have purchased using the Service; or (ii) you have purchased
outside the Service and transferred to such Crossmint Wallet. Crossmint does
not represent that your Crossmint Wallet or any NFTs stored therein will be
interoperable with any specific third-party platform or service, or that you
will be able to access and/or redeem any benefits embedded in or otherwise
connected to an NFT (such as, for example, token-gated access to a third-party
service) while such NFT is in your Crossmint Wallet.

If you wish to withdraw an NFT from your Crossmint Wallet to a third-party
digital wallet, you must submit a request to Crossmint. Crossmint will make
commercially reasonable efforts to effect all such withdrawals within a
reasonable period of time. You may be liable for gas fees and other
transaction costs in connection with such withdrawal.  Crossmint shall have no
liability to you in connection with any loss or error arising from or in
connection with any incorrect information (including, for e.g., third-party
digital wallet address) provided by you in connection with any such
withdrawal.

Except for what is set forth in section 7.1 below regarding Crossmint Non-
Custodial Wallet, your Crossmint Wallet cannot store fungible tokens, and thus
you cannot deposit fungible tokens in your Crossmint Wallet. In the event
that, for whatever reason, fungible tokens were sent to your Wallet Crossmint,
Crossmint shall return them to the wallet that originally sent the assets,
prior deduction of any gas fees and transaction costs. Crossmint is not
responsible for any loss that could arise from the return of any fungible
token to the originating wallet.

â

  7. 1     **Your Crossmint Non-Custodial Wallet**

**â** This Section 7.1 is applicable exclusively to Non-Custodial Wallets.
With respect to Non-Custodial Wallets: (a) your obligations, and the rights
and disclaimers of Crossmint, in this Section 7.1 are in addition to your
obligations, and the rights and disclaimers of Crossmint, elsewhere in this
Agreement; and (b) in the event of any contradiction with other sections of
this Agreement, the terms of this Section 7.1 shall apply with preference. You
exclusively are responsible for the management, security and use of your Non-
Custodial Wallet.

â

  * 7.1.1 **Creation of a Non-Custodial Wallet**   
Crossmintâs Non-Custodial Wallet is designed to allow you to store, manage,
and transact with any kind of digital assets (such as cryptocurrencies,
fungible tokens and NFTs), to the extent permitted by applicable law. In
contrast to the custodial services provided for NFTs, the Non-Custodial Wallet
is designed to ensure that you have exclusive control over your private keys,
mnemonic phrases, PIN and any other applicable access credentials that may be
in force from time to time.  
  
When you create your Non-Custodial Wallet with Crossmint, a private key is
uniquely assigned to you. You acknowledge and agree that all risks associated
with the use of the Non-Custodial Wallet and the safeguarding of your private
key are your sole responsibility.

  * 7.1.2 **Securing Your Private Keys**   
An encrypted backup of specific information linked to your Non-Custodial
Wallet may be stored on eligible devices. Crossmint maintains the exclusive
right to specify what devices are eligible. The private key is correlated with
the wallet address, and together, they facilitate the authorization of the
transfer of any digital assets to and from that wallet address. You hold sole
responsibility for the preservation and security of your private key and any
mnemonic phrase, PIN and any other applicable access credentials connected to
your Non-Custodial Wallet. It is imperative that you maintain the security of
your wallet address and your private key information, as well as any
applicable access credentials.  
  
It is of paramount importance that you backup your private keys and related
access credentials diligently. Any failure in doing so may culminate in the
loss of control over the digital assets associated with your Non-Custodial
Wallet. You acknowledge and agree that Crossmint does not receive or store,
and cannot access, your wallet password, encrypted private key, unencrypted
private key, mnemonic phrase or PIN, as the case may be, linked to your Non-
Custodial Wallet. Crossmint is unable to generate a new password for your Non-
Custodial Wallet if you forget your original password. If you  lose access to
the private key or other access credential for your Non-Custodial Wallet, you
accept and acknowledge that any digital assets associated with such wallet
address will become irreversibly inaccessible. In light of this, Crossmint
shall bear no responsibility or liability whatsoever in the event you are
unable to access your Non-Custodial Wallet for any reason, including but not
limited to your failure to secure your wallet address, wallet password,
encrypted private key, unencrypted private key, mnemonic phrase or PIN, as the
case may be.  
  
Upon the creation of a Non-Custodial Wallet, we strongly encourage you to
employ robust security measures to prevent the loss of access to, and control
over, your wallet. Recommended security measures include, but are not limited
to:  
  
Establishing a robust, unique password that is not utilized for any other
service or purpose, and employing biometric authentication if accessible.  
  
Refraining from storing your private key and seed phrase in unencrypted
formats online or in unsecured physical locations.  
  
Restricting access to your devices and your Non-Custodial Wallet.  
  
Implementing comprehensive precautions against potential malware on your
devices and networks.  
  
Keeping your wallet software up-to-date to maintain the security and
functionality of your Non-Custodial Wallet.

  * 7.1.3. **Limitation of Liability for Non-Custodial Wallets**.  The following limitations of liability of Crossmint apply to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law, and all such limitations of liability of Crossmint shall be cumulative:  
  
a. Loss of Access Credentials: Crossmint shall not be responsible or liable
for any loss, damage, or inconvenience suffered by you due to the loss,
disclosure, or unauthorized use of private keys, seed phrases, or other access
credentials related to the Non-Custodial Wallet.  
  
b. Transaction Errors: You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of
transaction details, including recipient addresses and transaction amounts.
Crossmint shall not be liable for any errors, losses, or damages resulting
from incorrect transaction details provided by users.  
  
c. Third-Party Access: Crossmint is not responsible for unauthorized access to
the Non-Custodial Wallet resulting from your actions or omissions, including
sharing access credentials or failing to secure your private keys, wallet
password, mnemonic phrase or PIN, as the case may be.  
  
d. Additional Disclaimer: Crossmint is not liable for any loss or damage, or
other unauthorized access to Non-Custodial Wallets, resulting, directly or
indirectly, from your actions or inactions, or other negligence, willful
misconduct or fraud.

â

  8.      **Pricing; Payment**

**â**

Any payment obligations you incur are binding at the time of purchase. You may
not substitute any other currency, whether cryptocurrency or fiat currency,
for the currency in which you have contracted to pay at the time of purchase.
For clarity, no fluctuation in the value of any currency, whether
cryptocurrency or otherwise, shall impact or excuse your obligations with
respect to any purchase.

All pricing and fees will be set forth at the time and point of sale. By using
the Service you agree to pay all applicable fees. Crossmint reserves the right
to adjust its pricing and fees at any time. We will notify you of the pricing
and fees which apply to your Transaction when you authorize the Transaction
and in each receipt we issue to you. Our fee may include gas fees to process a
Transaction, which we will calculate in our discretion, as well as the gas
fees for the eventual export of the NFT out of the Crossmint Wallet in the
future. We will notify you of the total amount of your purchase at or before
the time you authorize the Transaction. You are responsible for paying any
additional fees charged by your financial services provider. In the event that
we receive a payment in an amount less than the total due for the relevant
Transaction, we will reject the order, notify you of the reason for the
rejection, and (except where otherwise required to comply with applicable law)
return the payment less our processing costs. You may be responsible for
additional transaction fees, including gas fees, in connection with your
Transaction.

When a Transaction is initiated through your Account, we will assume that you
authorized such Transaction, unless you notify us otherwise. If you believe
you did not authorize a particular Transaction or that a Transaction was
incorrectly carried out, you must contact us as soon as possible. While we
endeavor to assist with unauthorized or erroneous Transactions, we cannot
guarantee that we will be able to reverse or correct any Transaction once it
has been initiated.

You cannot cancel, reverse or change any Transaction marked as complete or
pending. If your payment is not successful, if your Payment Method has
insufficient funds or if you reverse a payment made from funds in your bank
account, you authorize Crossmint, in its sole discretion, to either cancel the
Transaction or to debit your any of your other Payment Methods in any amount
necessary to complete the Transaction on its original terms. You agree to make
any such payment upon Crossmintâs request. You are responsible for
maintaining an adequate balance and/or sufficient credit limits in order to
avoid overdraft, non-sufficient funds (NSF) or similar fees charged by your
financial services provider. We reserve the right to refuse to process or to
cancel or reverse any Transaction in our sole discretion, even after funds
have been debited from your Payment Method(s), if we suspect the Transaction
violates this Agreement. In such instances, Crossmint will reverse the
Transaction and we are under no obligation to allow you to reinstate a
purchase or sale order at the same price or under the same terms as the
cancelled Transaction.

Crossmint may use a third-party payment processor to process any payment you
make to Crossmint. Crossmint may add or change any payment processing services
at any time. Such services may be subject to additional terms or conditions.
Whether a particular currency or cryptocurrency is accepted as a payment
method by Crossmint is in Crossmintâs sole discretion and subject to change
at any time.

Crossmint may from time to time make available certain conditional offers,
promotional prices, or discounted fees (each, a â**Promotion** â) to new
or existing users of the Service. The rules governing such Promotion will be
made available in connection with such Promotion. Crossmint will determine
your eligibility for any Promotion in its sole discretion and may change the
terms of or terminate a Promotion at any time, with or without notice to you.

  * trading an NFT at successively lower or higher prices for the purpose of creating or inducing a false, misleading or artificial appearance of activity in such NFT, unduly or improperly influencing the market price for such NFT or establishing a price which does not reflect the true state of the market in such NFT;
  * for the purpose of creating or inducing a false or misleading appearance of activity in an NFT or creating or inducing a false or misleading appearance with respect to the market in an NFT: (A) executing or causing the execution of any Transaction in an NFT which involves no material change in the beneficial ownership thereof; or (B) entering any order for the purchase or sale of an NFT with the knowledge that an order of substantially the same size, and at substantially the same price, for the sale of such NFT, has been or will be entered by or for the same or different parties; or
  * participating in, facilitating, assisting or knowingly transacting with any pool, syndicate or joint account organized for the purpose of unfairly or deceptively influencing the market price of an NFT;

For the avoidance of doubt, you represent and warrant that the NFTs you
purchase, sell or otherwise use through our the Service are pure âutilityâ
in nature, and bear no resemblance to a security as may currently be defined
by law or regulation, in neither form nor function; specifically, the
transactions to be performed through the Service will not constitute an
âinvestment contractâ, and thus they would fail the âHowey Testâ as
set forth in SEC v. W.J. Howey Co, 328 U.S. 293 (1946) so that the NFTs are
not considered securities under any circumstances.

**â**

  13.      **Investigations. Breach**

**â**

If Crossmint becomes aware of any possible violations by you of this
Agreement, Crossmint reserves the right to investigate such violations. If, as
a result of the investigation, Crossmint believes that any illicit or
otherwise criminal activity may have occurred, Crossmint reserves the right to
refer the matter to, and to cooperate with, any and all applicable legal
authorities. Crossmint is entitled, except to the extent prohibited by
applicable law, to disclose any information or materials on or in the Service,
including Content, in Crossmintâs possession in connection with your use of
the Service, to (i) comply with applicable laws, legal process or governmental
request; (ii) enforce this Agreement, (iii) respond to any claims that Content
violates the rights of third parties, (iv) respond to your requests for
customer service, or (v) protect the rights, property or personal safety of
Crossmint, its users, or the public, and all law enforcement or other
government officials, as Crossmint in its sole discretion believes to be
necessary or appropriate. By agreeing to this Agreement, you hereby provide
your irrevocable consent to such monitoring. You acknowledge and agree that
you have no expectation of privacy concerning your use of the Service,
including without limitation text, voice, or video communications.

In addition to the above, if pursuant to this investigation, Crossmint has
reasonable evidence to support that you have violated this Agreement and/or
you have engaged in any illicit or otherwise criminal activity, or you have
violated our NFT [Content
Policy](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kXv5gX7C8xHJFDAnCQTNUmXrDP05YYk1/view?usp=sharing),
Crossmint may, in its sole discretion:

  1. suspend your account;
  2. reverse or rescind any NFT purchase or transaction that it reasonably suspects has been conducted in violation of applicable law, fraud or this Agreement; 
  3. refuse to provide any NFT, Content, product, service and/or further access to the Service to you; 
  4. withhold any amount that may be due by Crossmint to you for any pending transaction; and/or 
  5. if no other remedy is available and you have not complied, to our satisfaction, with our requests to verify your compliance with applicable legislation, terminate your Account; 

all without no compensation whatsoever for you, and without prejudice to
additional indemnities and damage claims that may be applicable pursuant to
this Agreement or applicable legislation.

In the above (i) to (iv), Crossmint shall notify you of the actions taken, and
the reasons for it. If you believe that a mistake has been made, you will be
given the opportunity to appeal the decision by responding to the notification
or contacting support at [support@crossmint.io](mailto:support@crossmint.io),
as the case may be, and submitting the relevant evidence to support your
appeal. Crossmintâs decision to such appeal shall be final, without
prejudice to your rights under Section 20 of this Agreement.

In the latter (v) above (this is, if no other remedy is available and we
terminate your account), you hereby acknowledge and accept that any NFT left
behind in your Crossmint Wallet shall be repossessed by Crossmint, and thus
you hereby waive any right you may have over such NFT(s) and any legal action
to claim back ownership or any other right over the above mentioned NFT(s).

Additionally, Crossmint will also be entitled to confiscate and repossess any
NFT(s) that have been minted through transactions where a refund has been
successfully processed in favor of the user or where, after the corresponding
dispute proceeding has finalized, it has been deemed that such NFT is the
property of Crossmint or (for whatever reason, such as being the result of an
erroneous transaction) there is no ownership title whatsoever.

**â**

  14.      **Release**

**â**

You hereby release and forever discharge Crossmint and our affiliates,
officers, employees, agents, successors, and assigns (the â**Crossmint
Entities** â) from, and hereby waive and relinquish, each and every past,
present and future dispute, claim, controversy, demand, right, obligation,
liability, action and cause of action of every kind and nature (including
personal injuries, death, and property damage), that has arisen or arises
directly or indirectly out of, or that relates directly or indirectly to, the
Service (including any interactions with, or act or omission of, other users
of the Service or any Third-Party Properties). YOU HEREBY WAIVE CALIFORNIA
CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542, OR ANY SIMILAR LAW OR RULE OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION,
WHICH STATES IN SUBSTANCE: âA GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS THAT
THE CREDITOR OR RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR
HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE AND THAT, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR
HER, WOULD HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR OR
RELEASED PARTY.â

**â**

  15.      **Assumption of Risk Related to NFTs**

**â**

You acknowledge and agree that:

  * The prices of digital assets are extremely volatile. Fluctuations in the price of other digital assets could materially and adversely affect the NFTs, which may also be subject to significant price volatility. We cannot and do not guarantee that any NFTs will not lose value.

  * You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to Transactions involving your NFTs. Neither Crossmint nor any of the Crossmint Entities is responsible for determining the taxes that may apply to Transactions involving NFTs.

  * NFTs exist and can be transferred only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on the blockchain supporting such NFTs. 

  * There are risks associated with using digital currency and digital assets, including but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your Account. 

  * The legal and regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Service and the utility of NFTs.

  * There are risks associated with purchasing NFTs, including but not limited to, the risk of purchasing counterfeit assets, mislabeled assets, assets that are vulnerable to metadata decay, assets on smart contracts with bugs, and assets that may become untransferable. 

  * Crossmint reserves the right to hide NFTs that Crossmint suspects or believes may violate this Agreement. In such case, NFTs you purchase may become inaccessible on the Service. Under no circumstances shall the inability to access or view your NFTs on the Service serve as grounds for a claim against Crossmint.

  * Crossmint has no responsibility for the NFTs purchased or stored through the Service. Crossmint does not investigate and cannot guarantee or warrant the authenticity, originality, uniqueness, marketability, legality or value of any NFT.

  * Crossmint makes no representation, guarantee, or warranty of the authenticity or legality of any NFT or any Original Offeror.

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to indemnify,
defend, and hold harmless Crossmint and the Crossmint Entities from and
against all actual or alleged third party claims, damages, awards, judgments,
losses, liabilities, obligations, penalties, interest, fees, expenses

nature whatsoever arising out of or related to this Agreement or your use of
the Service, whether known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, matured or
unmatured, or suspected or unsuspected, in law or equity, whether in tort,
contract or otherwise (collectively, â**Claims** â), including, but not
limited to, damages to property or personal injury, that are caused by, arise

(d) your violation of the rights of any third party, including another user;

notify Crossmint of any third-party Claims and cooperate with the Crossmint
Entities in defending such Claims. You further agree that the Crossmint
Entities shall have control of the defense or settlement of any third-party
Claims. THIS INDEMNITY IS IN ADDITION TO, AND NOT IN LIEU OF, ANY OTHER
INDEMNITIES SET FORTH IN A SEPARATE WRITTEN AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND
CROSSMINT.

**â**

  17.      **Disclaimers**

**â**

THE SERVICE AND CONTENT CONTAINED THEREIN ARE PROVIDED ON AN âAS ISâ AND
âAS AVAILABLEâ BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. CROSSMINT (AND ITS SUPPLIERS) MAKE NO WARRANTY THAT THE

RELIABLE, COMPLETE, LEGAL, OR SAFE. CROSSMINT DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES
OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT AS TO THE SERVICE OR ANY CONTENT CONTAINED
THEREIN. CROSSMINT DOES NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT CONTENT ON THE SERVICE
IS ACCURATE, COMPLETE, RELIABLE, CURRENT, OR ERROR-FREE. WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE
FOR ANY LOSS OF ANY KIND FROM ANY ACTION TAKEN OR TAKEN IN RELIANCE ON
MATERIAL OR INFORMATION, CONTAINED ON THE SERVICE. WHILE CROSSMINT ATTEMPTS TO
MAKE YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICE AND CONTENT SAFE, CROSSMINT CANNOT

ON OUR SERVICE OR OUR SERVERS ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.
WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THE SECURITY OF ANY DATA THAT YOU DISCLOSE ONLINE. YOU
ACCEPT THE INHERENT SECURITY RISKS OF PROVIDING INFORMATION AND DEALING ONLINE
OVER THE INTERNET AND WILL NOT HOLD US RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY BREACH OF SECURITY
UNLESS IT IS DUE TO OUR GROSS NEGLIGENCE.

WE WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY LOSSES YOU SUSTAIN AS A
RESULT OF YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE. WE TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR, AND WILL NOT

NFTS ARE INTANGIBLE DIGITAL ASSETS. THEY EXIST ONLY BY VIRTUE OF THE OWNERSHIP
RECORD MAINTAINED IN THE BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK. ANY TRANSFER OF TITLE THAT MIGHT
OCCUR IN ANY UNIQUE DIGITAL ASSET OCCURS ON THE DECENTRALIZED LEDGER WITHIN
THE BLOCKCHAIN PLATFORM. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT CROSSMINT OR ANY CROSSMINT
ENTITY CAN EFFECT THE TRANSFER OF TITLE OR RIGHT IN ANY NFTS. WE CANNOT AND DO
NOT GUARANTEE THAT ANY NFT WILL HAVE OR RETAIN ANY INHERENT VALUE, OR THAT YOU
WILL BE ABLE TO SELL OR RESELL ANY NFT PURCHASED THROUGH THE SERVICE.

Crossmint is not responsible for any losses or harms sustained by you due to
vulnerability or any kind of failure, abnormal behavior of software (e.g.,
smart contract), blockchains, or any other features of or inherent to the
NFTs. Crossmint is not responsible for casualties due to any delay or failure
to report any issues with any blockchain supporting NFTs, including without
limitation forks, technical node issues, or any other issues that result in
losses of any sort.

Nothing in this Agreement shall exclude or limit liability of either party for
fraud, death or bodily injury caused by negligence, violation of laws, or any
other activity that cannot be limited or excluded under the laws applicable to
your jurisdiction. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
WARRANTIES IN CONTRACTS WITH CONSUMERS, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY
TO YOU.

**â**

  18.      **Limitation of Liability**

**â**

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL CROSSMINT BE LIABLE
TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFIT OR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL,
EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING FROM THIS
AGREEMENT, THE SERVICE, ANY ITEMS, OR FOR ANY DAMAGES RELATED TO LOSS OF
REVENUE, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, LOSS OF
USE, LOSS OF GOODWILL, OR LOSS OF DATA, AND WHETHER CAUSED BY TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE), BREACH OF CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF FORESEEABLE AND EVEN IF

USE OF, THE SERVICE IS UNDERTAKEN BY YOU AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND
YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR
MOBILE DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA RESULTING THEREFROM.

THE MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF CROSSMINT ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY
RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICE, CONTENT
(INCLUDING YOUR CONTENT), OR ANY NFTS PURCHASED, STORED, OR WITHDRAWN THROUGH
THE SERVICE EXCEED THE GREATER OF (A) $100 OR (B) THE AMOUNT RETAINED BY
CROSSMINT IN THE TRANSACTION OR INCIDENT THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF THE CLAIM.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to
you.

**â**

  19.      **Data Protection and Security**      

**â**

Personal Data. You acknowledge that we may process personal data in relation
to you, and personal data that you have provided or in the future provide to
us in connection with this Agreement, or the Services. Accordingly, you
represent and warrant that before providing any such personal data to us, you
have read, understood and acknowledged our [Privacy
Policy](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jrZAiwZp8p2WQX30wG3F42iCB3dkhRpn/view).

Security Breach. If you suspect that your Account or any of your security
details have been compromised or if you become aware of any fraud or attempted
fraud or any other security incident (including a cyber-security attack)
affecting you and/or Crossmint (collectively a "**Security Breach** "), you
must notify Crossmint Support immediately at <https://help.crossmint.com/>.
Prompt reporting of a Security Breach does not imply that Crossmint will be
liable to you for any losses suffered as a result of the Security Breach.

Computer Viruses. We shall not bear any liability, whatsoever, for any damage
or interruptions caused by any computer viruses or other malicious code that
may affect your computer or other equipment, or any phishing, spoofing or any
other kind of cyber-attack.

**â**

  20.      **Dispute Resolution; Arbitration**      

**â**

Please read the arbitration agreement in this Section (â**Arbitration
Agreement** â) carefully. It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING
ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.

Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. You agree that any dispute, claim, or
request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of the Service,
to any products sold or distributed through the Service, to any NFTs, or to
any aspect of your relationship with Crossmint, will be resolved by binding
arbitration, rather than in court, except that (i) you may assert claims or
seek relief in small claims court if your claims qualify; and (ii) you or
Crossmint may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse
of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain
names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). This Arbitration Agreement
shall apply, without limitation, to all disputes or claims and requests for
relief that arose or were asserted before the effective date of this Agreement
or any prior version of this Agreement.  

Arbitration Rules and Forum. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the
interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. To begin an
arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and
describing your dispute or claim or request for relief to us at
support@Crossmint.io. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an
established alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving
claims, counterclaims, or request for relief under $250,000, not inclusive of
attorneysâ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMSâs most current
version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at
http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/; all other disputes
shall be subject to JAMSâs most current version of the Comprehensive
Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-
comprehensive-arbitration/. JAMSâs rules are also available at
www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267. If JAMS is not available
to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. If the
arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMSâs filing,
administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from
JAMS, Crossmint will pay them for you. In addition, we will reimburse all such
JAMSâs filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for disputes,
claims, or requests for relief totaling less than $10,000 unless the
arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the
arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person
in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location. Any
judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court
of competent jurisdiction.

Authority of Arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (i)
determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement and (ii)
resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability,
enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not
limited to, any assertion that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement
is void or voidable. The arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if
any, of you and us. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with
any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator
shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any
claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and
to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under
applicable law, the arbitral forumâs rules, and this Agreement (including
the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and
statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on
which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.
The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis
that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is
final and binding upon you and us.  

Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND CROSSMINT HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND
STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A
JURY. You and we are instead electing that all disputes, claims, or requests
for relief shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement,
except as specified in Section 17.a (Application of Arbitration Agreement)
above. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and
relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would. However,
there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration
award is subject to very limited review.

Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief. ALL DISPUTES, CLAIMS, AND
REQUESTS FOR RELIEF WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE
ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, ONLY
INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER
CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.
If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of
any of this sectionâs limitations as to a given dispute, claim, or request
for relief, then such aspect must be severed from the arbitration and brought
into the State or Federal Courts located in the State of New York. All other
disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be arbitrated.

30-Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt out of the provisions of
this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt
out to support@crossmint.io within thirty (30) days after first becoming
subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and
address, your username (if any), and an unequivocal statement that you want to
opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration
Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you.
Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other
arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the
future, with us.

Severability. Except as provided in Section 17.e (Waiver of Class or Other
Non-Individualized Relief), if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement
are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific
part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the
remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and
effect. Survival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the
termination of your relationship with us.

Modification. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
we agree that if we make any future material change to this Arbitration
Agreement, you may reject that change within thirty (30) days of such change
becoming effective by writing us at support@crossmint.io and expressly opting
out of this Arbitration Agreement.

EU Users. In addition to the above, if you are a user accessing or using our
services from within the European Union, pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2022/2065
of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 October 2022 on a Single
Market For Digital Services and amending Directive 2000/31/EC (i.e. the
Digital Services Act or â**DSA** â), the following applies: we will
endeavor to resolve any complaint or dispute you may have with us in relation
to our services through our internal complaint-handling system. If we are
unable to resolve the complaint or dispute to your satisfaction, you have the
right to seek to resolve the dispute through an alternative dispute resolution
(ADR) procedure, facilitated by an EU-approved ADR provider. Further, you may
be eligible to use the European Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) platform,
available at http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/, to resolve any dispute with
us. The use of an ADR or the ODR platform does not prohibit you from pursuing
legal remedies in your local jurisdiction.

**â**

  21.      **General**

the Service, or any features or parts thereof, whether temporarily or

Agreement and will not affect the validity or enforceability of any remaining
part of that term, clause or provision, or any other term, clause or provision
of this Agreement. Your relationship to Crossmint is that of an independent
contractor, and neither party is an agent or partner of the other. this
Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be
transferred or assigned by you without the prior written consent of Crossmint.
Crossmintâs failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement
shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Except as otherwise
provided herein, this Agreement are intended solely for the benefit of
Crossmint and you and are not intended to confer third party beneficiary
rights upon any other person or entity.
