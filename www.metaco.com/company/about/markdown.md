About us

Founded in 2015 in Switzerland, Metaco is an enterprise technology company
whose mission is to enable financial and non-financial institutions to
securely build their digital asset operations. The company’s core product,
Harmonize™, is a mission-critical orchestration platform for digital assets.
From asset-agnostic custody and trading to tokenization, staking and smart
contract management, the platform seamlessly connects institutions to the
broad universe of decentralized finance and Web3 decentralized applications.

Metaco has established itself as the institutional standard for digital asset
infrastructure, trusted by the world’s largest global custodians, banks,
regulated exchanges, and corporates. Its software and technology solutions
enable institutions to store, trade, issue and manage any type of digital
asset – such as crypto and digital currencies, digital securities, non-
fungible tokens (NFTs) – with the highest possible security and agility.
