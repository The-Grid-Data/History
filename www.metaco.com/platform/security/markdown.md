## **Keep your own keys**

Metaco does not manage keys or key shards, it does not participate in any co-
signing process nor does it provide any type of financial service which is or
could become subject to being regulated. All key material stays with our
clients.

Our commitment

security is not just computer science, it is a mindset. Our approach to our

transaction execution, with no single point of compromise.”
