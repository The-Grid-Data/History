Testimonials

“Our work with **our strategic partner Metaco** will help ensure that Mercari
maintains a standard of excellence commensurate with the most stringent of
true institutional use case expectations. We are anticipating that without
ultra-high grade domestic institutional digital asset custody the industry
will struggle to attract wide based internal compliance and regulatory
support.”
