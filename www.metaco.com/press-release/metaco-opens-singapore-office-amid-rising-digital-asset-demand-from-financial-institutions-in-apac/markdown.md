#### Lausanne, Switzerland – 05 October, 2021

[METACO](https://www.metaco.com/),** ** the leading provider of security-
critical software and infrastructure to the digital asset ecosystem, today
announces the launch of its Asia Pacific headquarters in Singapore, with a
strong team managed by newly appointed Managing Director APAC, [Patrick
Enjalbal](https://sg.linkedin.com/in/patrick-enjalbal-4175a86).

With demand accelerating for institutional-grade digital asset custody and
trading infrastructure, the opening of the Singapore office and expanded APAC
headcount demonstrates METACO’s commitment to offering best-in-class services
to existing and future customers in the region, allowing the company to
continue enabling banks and other institutions to safely enter the crypto
economy through [Harmonize](https://www.metaco.com/platform/harmonize/), its
digital asset orchestration system.

METACO has appointed [Patrick Enjalbal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-
enjalbal-4175a86/), a former Director at Singapore-based financial technology
consultancy, Luxoft, as its Managing Director APAC. Patrick brings over two
decades of experience advising and managing the successful deployment of
institutional-grade financial technology solutions in APAC and beyond. [Martin
Frick](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinfrick/) has also joined as Senior
Sales Advisor. Frick was previously the Managing Director of Temenos APAC,
where he led operations for the banking software provider across the region.
In addition to leadership appointments, APAC headcount in business development
and operations has increased significantly, with further expansion expected in
the coming months.

**[Andre Israel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andre-
israel-a10371/?originalSubdomain=ch), COO at METACO, commented,**

> “ _We are proud to announce the launch of our Singapore office and the
> appointment of Patrick Enjalbal as Managing Director APAC, ably assisted by
> Martin Frick. METACO continues to grow at a significant pace, and this
> expansion will enable us to cater to high levels of demand in the region, as
> well as continue offering best-in-class services to our existing APAC
> customers and partners.”_

METACO enables institutions to secure, trade, and manage any cryptocurrency or
digital asset. As institutions expand their digital asset operations, they
often need to work with multiple third-party self-custody vaults, sub-
custodians and liquidity providers. This creates institutional challenges in
terms of security, and scalability, with a proliferation of access points
weakening end-to-end processes. As a digital asset orchestration system,
METACO Harmonize provides the unifying governance solution to manage this
complexity and mitigate the risks for institutional digital asset managers in
working with various partner solutions.

**Patrick Enjalbal, Managing Director APAC at METACO, commented,**

> “ _I’m thrilled to join the deeply talented team at METACO at such a pivotal
> time in the growth of the company. Over the coming months, we are looking to
> scale our operations in APAC to cater to the significant levels of interest
> that we are seeing from institutional clients in digital asset
> orchestration, integration and management.”_

**[Alex Manson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-
manson-919a8310a/?originalSubdomain=sg), Global Head of[ SC
Ventures](https://scventures.io/) _ _ and Board Member at METACO, commented:**

> _“It is clear that digital assets are here to stay, and furthermore that
> this particular market will experience extraordinary developments over time.
> Financial institutions are well placed to capitalize on this market
> opportunity, and we have already observed increased levels of adoption by
> banks and wealth managers in APAC. We are pleased to see our strategic
> partner METACO strengthening their presence in the region, driven exactly by
> this high demand for best-in-class secure and agile infrastructure for
> digital asset management.”_
