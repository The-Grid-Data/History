### Partnership addresses market demand for flexible, institutional-grade
infrastructure for the management of digital assets

#### Lausanne, Switzerland – February 2, 2021

**METACO** , the leading provider of security-critical infrastructure enabling
financial institutions to enter the digital asset ecosystem, announced a
strategic partnership with [Cobalt](https://www.cobaltdl.com/), an award-
winning fintech firm focused on re-engineering the institutional FX market
from the ground up. This partnership provides an institutional-grade Software
as a Service (SaaS) solution for digital asset settlement.

As institutional adoption of digital assets accelerates, banks and financial
institutions are hindered by the lack of available institutional-grade
infrastructure to fit their needs. Together, they are addressing this
increasing demand by integrating METACO’s institutional operating system for
digital assets, [SILO](https://www.metaco.com/platform/harmonize/), with
Cobalt’s interoperable FX and digital assets platform to offer a fully
integrated end to end SaaS solution for the storage, limit allocation and
intraday settlement of digital assets, with institutional-grade security
standards.

**Seamus Donoghue, VP Sales & Business Development at METACO commented:**

> “There remain many frictions for banks and other large trading institutions
> to enter and scale in crypto markets and we are very excited to partner with
> Cobalt and enable our clients to leverage their market leading post-trade
> solutions in fiat and crypto. SILO delivers a SaaS custody solution that in
> combination with Cobal`s post-trade settlement solutions will deliver the
> leading institutional infrastructure for custody and trading to our banking
> and exchange clients.”

Launched in 2018, METACO’s institutional operating system for digital assets,
[SILO](https://www.metaco.com/platform/harmonize/), enables large financial
institutions to securely integrate, store, and manage cryptocurrencies,
tokens, and distributed ledgers. Its secure framework for digital asset
custody, transaction management, trading, and tokenization has made it the
leading choice for banks and exchanges, with implementations by leading Tier 1
and 2 banks including [Standard Chartered](https://www.sc.com/en/) Bank among
others in the US, Switzerland, Europe, and South East Asia.

**Adrian Patten, Chairman at Cobalt said:**

> “METACO is a global leader in digital asset custody solutions for
> institutions, and our partnership represents a commitment to market-leading
> innovation and institutional-grade security in the digital assets market.
> Financial institutions are rapidly accelerating their roadmaps for the
> adoption of digital assets, and require flexible, trusted and scalable
> infrastructure to fit their needs — precisely what we deliver with this
> partnership.”

The firms are also jointly collaborating on further products, with shared
synergies across a number of areas of innovation.

Patten, Chairman of Cobalt are available for interview.   _
