### Integration addresses market demand for institutional-grade infrastructure
for the management of DeFi tokens.

#### Lausanne, Switzerland – 18 March, 2021

[METACO](https://www.metaco.com/),** ** the leading provider of security-
critical infrastructure enabling financial institutions to enter the digital
asset ecosystem, announced an integration with [Aave](https://aave.com/), a
decentralized, open-source, and non-custodial liquidity protocol on Ethereum.
Aave’s market size is in excess of $2 billion – a pioneer with record growth
for DeFi. With this integration, METACO has brought the AAVE token into
METACO’s [digital asset orchestration
system](https://www.metaco.com/platform/harmonize/), enabling banks and
institutions to securely integrate, store, and manage cryptocurrencies,
tokens, and distributed ledgers.

To meet the rapidly growing institutional demand for digital assets, METACO
has also integrated support for AAVE into both its [orchestration system and
institutional-grade custody
solution](https://www.metaco.com/platform/harmonize/), allowing institutional
clients to avail of a range of flexible wallet options, and access a
comprehensive list of smart contract functionalities across the asset
lifecycle including issuance, staking and lending support.

METACO’s digital asset orchestration system provides out of the box support
for Aave and a number of other major DeFi protocols including
[Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/), [Synthetix](https://synthetix.io/) and
[Compound](https://compound.finance/), making METACO the leading choice for
institutions looking to incorporate DeFi tokens into their digital asset use-
case. METACO’s secure framework for digital asset custody, transaction
management, trading, and tokenization has made it the leading choice for banks
and exchanges, with implementations by leading Tier 1 and 2 banks including
[Standard Chartered Bank](https://www.sc.com/en/) among others in the US,
Switzerland, Europe, and South East Asia.

**Adrien Treccani, CEO and Founder at METACO commented,**

> “ _As the institutional adoption of digital assets accelerates, investors
> are gathering a broader appetite for crypto assets, with interest in DeFi
> tokens rapidly gathering momentum. At METACO, we are constantly striving to
> innovate, expand and improve upon our service offerings. This integration
> with Aave, a proven DeFi protocol, demonstrates our commitment to innovation
> in DeFi and providing our clients with the cutting-edge technology and
> flexibility they need to stay apace with the rapidly evolving digital assets
> ecosystem_.”

One of the fastest growing DeFi protocols globally, Aave is a decentralized
non-custodial liquidity protocol where users can participate as depositors or
borrowers. Users can both deposit cryptoassets on which they earn interest, or
borrow cryptoassets in a variety of ways.

**Stani Kulechov, CEO of Aave said,**

> “ _2021 has seen financial institutions pouring into the digital asset
> space, and now they are looking at DeFi as a new way to manage liquidity.
> METACO offers access to DeFi assets in a safe and secure way, making it
> easier for institutional adoption and onboarding.”_
