#### London – 26 January, 2021

[IHS Markit](https://ihsmarkit.com/index.html), a world leader in critical
information, analytics and solutions, today announced a partnership with
[METACO](https://www.metaco.com/), the leading provider of security-critical
software and infrastructure to Tier 1 banks in the digital asset ecosystem.
The partnership delivers best-in-class post-trade securities processing
capabilities in digital assets for financial institutions.

As the institutional adoption of digital assets accelerates, banks and
financial institutions are hindered by the lack of available institutional-
grade infrastructure to fit their needs. To address this need, IHS Markit’s
post-trade securities processing platform is integrated with [METACO
Harmonize](https://metaco.com/harmonize), a secure digital asset orchestration
system, to provide a single multi-asset platform for financial institutions to
securely custody and manage digital assets alongside traditional assets. This
integrated platform provides access for institutional clients to a highly
scalable, multi-tenant software solution that secures, automates and
standardizes the trade, settlement and corporate actions lifecycles.

> “ _The partnership provides a seamless integration and utilizes both firms’
> cloud first philosophy and infrastructure, with IHS Markit’s Integrated
> Message Bridge (IMB) providing the gateway between the movement of
> traditional and digital assets, while leveraging the industry standard
> messaging protocols inherent within our post-trade securities platform_ ,”

said [Ankush Zutshi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankush-zutshi-25b10010/),
vice president, corporate actions and securities processing, IHS Markit.

> “ _We are excited to partner with METACO to provide a unified, integrated
> solution for the secure orchestration of digital asset workflows  and the
> safekeeping of digital assets along with traditional_.”

METACO Harmonize enables institutions to securely manage any end-to-end
digital asset use cases from cryptocurrency custody and trading to
tokenization, smart contract management and decentralized finance (DeFi). As
the digital asset industry matures, most organizations require optionality to
reduce the risk of third-party dependency, seeking to work with multiple
vaults, sub-custodians, and liquidity providers. METACO Harmonize delivers the
most flexible and secure custody solutions in the market in combination with
the secure orchestration of workflows across the entire digital stack. It
transforms the complexity of working with multiple self-custody providers,
custodians, and other solutions into an end-to-end secure, highly scalable,
and agile stack with full distribution of all processes to eliminate any
single point of failure.

[Seamus Donoghue](https://www.linkedin.com/in/seamus-donoghue-2504115a/), VP
of Strategic Alliances METACO, said,

> “ _There remain many frictions for banks and other large financial
> institutions entering the crypto markets. METACO Harmonize, our digital
> asset orchestration platform, is a unique offering that ensures end-to-end
> security with no single point of failure across all digital asset processes
> while delivering the scalability and agility required by the world`s largest
> financial institutions. Our partnership with IHS Markit integrates their
> market-leading post-trade securities processing capabilities to provide
> firms with the highest level of security while delivering the flexibility
> and agility they need to successfully operate at scale and with agility in
> the rapidly growing digital asset industry_.

The IHS Markit Securities Processing solution enables clients to redefine
their post-trade technologies and processes to gain a competitive advantage,
achieve market differentiation and accelerate business growth. It allows users
to replace multiple applications and discrete processes with a cloud platform
and integrated post-trade framework that automates and standardizes securities
processing across the trade and settlement lifecycle.

data](https://ihsmarkit.com/products/markit/data-information-services.html),
[software and technology
platforms](https://ihsmarkit.com/products/markit/financial-technology-
