#### Singapore – 20 January, 2022

[METACO](https://www.metaco.com/), the leading provider of security-critical
software and infrastructure to the digital asset ecosystem, has announced that
[Union Bank of the Philippines](https://www.unionbankph.com/) (UnionBank) is
implementing its digital asset management services. UnionBank is deploying
services on [IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud), in order to leverage the
confidential computing capabilities of IBM’s digital asset infrastructure
which are fully integrated with METACO’s digital asset orchestration system,
[METACO Harmonize](https://www.metaco.com/platform/harmonize/).

One of the largest universal banks in the Philippines, with over $15 billion
in assets under management, UnionBank, will leverage [METACO
Harmonize](https://www.metaco.com/platform/harmonize/), METACO’s digital asset
orchestration system, to manage its digital asset operations.  UnionBank can
improve insurability with additional FIPS 140-2 Level 4 certified physical
controls for managing and migrating keys, mitigate potential operational risk
and loss events through trusted threshold signatures and hardened policies,
and address insider collusions with third-party audited source code
deployments. These capabilities are supported by IBM Cloud Hyper Protect
Services[1]

METACO Harmonize enables institutions to manage a range of end-to-end digital
asset use cases from cryptocurrency custody and trading to tokenization, smart
contract management and decentralized finance (DeFi). UnionBank’s launch
follows the recent opening of METACO’s Asia Pacific headquarters in Singapore,
established to ensure that METACO offers best-in-class services to UnionBank
and other customers in the region.

**[Patrick Enjalbal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-enjalbal-4175a86/),
VP Customer Success and MD, APAC at METACO, commented,**

> “ _We are proud further to expand our significant presence in APAC, with
> Union Bank of the Philippines, a national leader in banking services. METACO
> continues to grow at a significant pace. With the recent launch of our APAC
> headquarters in Singapore, we can ensure that we continue to offer best-in-
> class services to UnionBank and other customers and partners in the
> region.”_

Founded in 1982, UnionBank is a leader in innovation in banking technology and
was one of the first institutions to launch electronic savings accounts in the
country with the EON Cyber Account. With over 388 branches nationwide,
UnionBank is a key provider of corporate cash management and B2B banking
services for local and multinational companies in the Philippines _._

> _“We have the passion for meaningful and sustainable reinvention. We value
> our strategic partners, like METACO, and collaborate with them in an
> alliance that is meaningful in pursuit of a common vision. And for
> UnionBank, that common vision is customer centricity driven by emerging
> technologies and innovation”,  _**said  [Henry
> Aguda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/henryaguda/), UnionBank’s Senior
> Executive Vice President, Chief Technology & Operations Officer and Chief
> Transformation Officer.**

As the digital asset industry matures, most organizations require optionality
to reduce the risk of third-party dependency, seeking to work with multiple
vaults, sub-custodians, and liquidity providers. Working with numerous service
providers creates additional complexity. Institutions face challenges in terms
of security, and scalability, with a proliferation of access points weakening
end-to-end processes. METACO Harmonize manages this complexity and mitigates
the risks in working with an ecosystem of partners by acting as the
overarching policy layer to ensure tight management of digital asset
operations, coupled with a single point of integration to its various internal
systems.
