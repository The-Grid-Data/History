#### Lausanne, Switzerland – 4 April 2023 —

[Metaco,](https://www.metaco.com/) the leading provider of digital asset
technology infrastructure to regulated financial institutions, has partnered
with [VP Bank](https://ch.vpbank.com/en) (SWX: VPBN), one of the largest
private banks in Liechtenstein. The collaboration leverages Metaco’s flagship
platform,
[Harmonize](https://www.metaco.com/platform/harmonize/)[™](https://www.metaco.com/platform/harmonize/)
_,_ to allow VP Bank the optionality to expand its digital asset custody and
tokenization services beyond art and physical collector items, such as being
able to support tokenized financial assets or minting, burning and storage of
tokens.

With six locations across important financial centers in Europe, Asia and BVI,
and [over 46 billion CHF](https://www.vpbank.com/en/news/2022/vp-bank-group-
holding-its-own-challenging-
environment#:~:text=Due%20to%20the%20negative%20market,as%20of%2030%20June%202022.)
in assets under management at the end of 2022, VP Bank is a globally
recognized leader in bespoke and innovative investment and asset management
solutions for private clients and HNWIs. Pioneered since 2021, VP Bank’s
digital asset strategy initially envisioned the tokenization and custody of
collectible physical assets such as jewels, paintings, watches and sculptures
— creating a future-oriented offering combined with the customary security
standards of a regulated bank. To continue executing on its strong client
demand momentum, VP Bank required scalable and secure digital asset IT
infrastructure that allows it to exploit new business opportunities when
issuing, holding and managing digital assets on behalf of its clients.

Following a diligent selection process, VP Bank has selected Metaco as its
preferred digital asset custody and orchestration technology partner, uniquely
meeting the bank’s stringent requirements for institutional-grade key
management and smart contract governance capabilities, as it seeks to expand
its tokenization of digital and real-world assets in a highly scalable and
secure manner, while remaining fully compliant with the regulations of the
[_Token and Trusted Technology Service Provider Act (TVTG)_](https://www.fma-
li.li/en/fintech-and-tvtg/tvtg.html). The unique orchestration capabilities
and policy framework governing all digital asset interactions with liquidity
venues, decentralized finance applications and other third-party systems were
among other critical criteria in the selection process.

After a successful five-month modernization project, VP Bank now consumes
Metaco Harmonize™ as a managed service, fully integrated into the banks’ core
banking system. By consolidating its digital asset technology landscape to a
single, mission-critical custody and tokenization platform to secure and
govern its operations end-to-end, VP Bank is able to take its commercial
offerings to the next level and scale to millions of custody accounts,
protected by the ultimate combination of multi-party computation and hardware
encryption technologies, without the overhead requirements of internally
managing any physical infrastructure.

**[Marcel Fleisch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcel-
fleisch-064210153/?originalSubdomain=li), Chief Product Officer at VP Bank
commented, commented: **

> “ _At VP Bank, we are committed to rethink wealth management by combining
> traditional banking with digital ecosystems to create whole new services and
> opportunities for our clients. By partnering with Metaco to offer a secure
> and scalable platform to tokenize and custody all types of financial,
> digital and real-world assets, we take a new major step towards building VP
> Bank’s foundation of the future.”_

**[Seamus Donoghue](https://www.linkedin.com/in/seamus-donoghue-2504115a/),
Chief Growth Officer at Metaco, also added:**

> “ _We are proud that VP Bank, one of the largest banks in Liechtenstein and
> a future oriented bank for private clients and intermediaries, is now
> relying on Metaco Harmonize to scale its digital asset custody and
> tokenization services. The bank-grade orchestration capabilities of the
> Harmonize platform enables the secure management of a range of digital asset
> use cases, allowing banks and financial institutions to satisfy demand for
> new asset classes and expand their business model in any direction_.”
