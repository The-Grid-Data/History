### _Integration addresses market demand for institutional-grade staking
infrastructure  _



#### Lausanne, Switzerland – May 4, 2021

[METACO](https://www.metaco.com/),** ** the leading provider of security-
critical infrastructure to the digital asset ecosystem, announced an
integration with [Tezos](https://tezos.com/), the decentralized, public
blockchain that evolves by upgrading itself. One of the original proof-of-
stake blockchain protocols, Tezos has a market cap in excess of $4 billion – a
pioneer redefining value exchange in a digitally connected world.

METACO has integrated support for tez (XTZ), the native token of the Tezos
ecosystem, into [Harmonize](https://www.metaco.com/platform/harmonize/), its
digital asset orchestration system. Harmonize orchestrates digital asset
management for banks and institutions across numerous use cases from
decentralized finance (DeFi), to tokenization, cryptocurrency custody, and
smart contract management. Support will also enable institutions to manage a
comprehensive list of functionalities on the Tezos blockchain, including
staking capabilities, via both delegated staking services, which allow clients
to generate low-interest rewards from joining shared staking pools, or staking
directly to dedicated validators.

[Adrien Treccani](https://ch.linkedin.com/in/atreccani), CEO and Founder at
METACO, commented,

> “ _As the institutional adoption of digital assets accelerates, investors
> are gaining a broader appetite for crypto assets, with interest in the areas
> of DeFi, staking, and tokenization gathering momentum. As a result,
> orchestration of these complex capabilities and interactions across an
> increasingly diverse set of digital asset applications has become a core
> need for many institutions.  **METACO Harmonize** , our digital asset
> orchestration system, provides institutions with the requisite flexibility
> to address this need. Integrating **Tezos** , a leading proof-of-stake
> blockchain, into our orchestration system demonstrates our industry-leading
> innovation in delivering clients the cutting-edge technology and flexibility
> they need to stay apace with the rapidly evolving digital assets
> ecosystem.”_

**METACO Harmonize**  provides an end-to-end solution for functionalities on
Tezos and other major proof-of-stake and DeFi protocols, including;
[Aave](https://aave.com/), [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/), and
[Compound](https://compound.finance/), making METACO the leading choice for
institutions looking to incorporate staking and DeFi into their digital asset
use-case. **Harmonize**  is the orchestration layer for a range of sub-
products that allow institutions and firms of all sizes to seamlessly
integrate potential future use-cases into their infrastructure as they evolve.

Born in 2014, Tezos was one of the first protocols to use proof-of-stake
consensus, designed to be truly scalable, decentralized, and empower network
stakeholders. A self-upgradable blockchain, Tezos enables dynamic innovation
through a governance structure that allows stakeholders to vote on changes to
the network.

_Seamus Donoghue, VP of Strategic Alliances at METACO is available for
interview._
