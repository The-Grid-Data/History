#### Lausanne, Switzerland — 5 May 2022

[METACO](https://www.metaco.com/), the leading provider of security-critical
software and infrastructure to the digital asset ecosystem, has announced a
partnership with [Brink’s](https://brinks.com/) (NYSE:BCO), the global leader
in total cash management, route-based secure logistics and payment solutions.

Brink’s extends METACO’s institutional digital asset custody services into the
physical world through its internationally recognized secure logistics
expertise and global network of vault locations. These capabilities provide
financial institutions with an unparalleled, segregated, and fully
distributed, disaster recovery solution for critical private key recovery
backups.

[METACO Harmonize](https://www.metaco.com/platform/harmonize/), the global
leader with Tier 1 financial institutions for digital asset custody and
orchestration, ensures that all processes across a clients’ digital asset
offering are fully distributed with no single point of compromise. Key
recovery is no exception, and Harmonize clients can create multiple back-ups,
each of which is stored on its own FIPS 140-2 Level 3 certified smart card. A
client specified, “m of n” subset of the smart cards can be used to recover
the crypto assets in the event of a disaster.

It has always been an open question from financial institutions to determine
what are the best practices to store the smart cards and how to implement the
right disaster recovery framework. This partnership resolves this uncertainty
and brings together the only custody platform that ensures “no single point of
compromise” in the software and infrastructure stack, with a physical back-up
solution that is end-to-end secure and fully distributed to equally ensure no
physical and operational “single point of compromise” for key recovery storage
and logistics.

**[Seamus Donoghue](https://www.linkedin.com/in/seamus-
donoghue-2504115a/?originalSubdomain=ch), VP of Strategic Alliances at METACO,
commented,**

> _“We’re proud to further strengthen our industry leading digital asset
> custody capabilities to ensure clients have a complete and best-in-class
> disaster recovery solution. ’Security by design’ is our founding principle
> as we, and our clients, believe all assets will eventually be managed on-
> chain._

**Donoghue added:**

> _“A robust recovery solution is not an afterthought, but a core foundation
> to be able to securely build and scale a bank’s digital asset future.
> Brink’s is a market leader in physical security solutions and our
> partnership adds a critical service for institutional clients in the
> transport and distributed storage of physical key backups across multiple
> secure vaults, complementing METACO’s value proposition of ’no single point
> of compromise‘ into the physical realm of key recovery.”_

Founded in 1859, Brink’s is a global leader in security solutions including
the management, storage and transfer of valuable assets for banks, government
agencies, central banks, mints and jewelers. Brink’s has an established global
network of facilities and operations in 53 countries, with customers in more
than 100 countries. Brink’s is growing its digital asset security services in
response to accelerating demand.

**[OIiver Buckle-Wright](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliver-buckle-
wright-4586683/), Senior Commercial Director at Brink’s, commented,**

> “ _We are delighted to be partnering with METACO to help enable the
> transition from digital to physically segregated storage solutions across
> our international footprint. Our goal is to provide a combined secure air
> gapped service to allow METACO’s clients to scale their digital asset
> portfolio while addressing internal risk concerns.”_
