#### Sydney and Singapore – 02 June 2022** **

[Mercari](https://www.mercari.com.au/), which operates a licensed Australian
Tier 1 wholesale financial derivatives exchange, has selected
[METACO](https://www.metaco.com/), the market-leading provider of digital
asset custody orchestration technology to complex, global financial
institutions, to launch its institutional digital asset custody operations.
Mercari is deploying its technology on [IBM ](https://www.ibm.com/)Cloud in
order to leverage the confidential computing capabilities of IBM’s digital
asset infrastructure.

Mercari has been developing a growing suite of crypto asset investment
services. In January, it launched the Mercari DAR Crypto Reference Rates, the
first local and robust AUD crypto-asset benchmarks for the Australia and Asia
markets.

To launch its institutional digital asset custody offering, Mercari will use
METACO’s digital asset custody and orchestration platform,
[Harmonize](https://www.metaco.com/platform/harmonize/), helping enable
clients to securely store, trade, and settle digital assets. Harmonize was
built in partnership with Tier 1 banks and offers the highest standards of
security and compliance for Mercari to operate in the digital assets sector.
This foundational infrastructure provides Mercari with the option to further
expand its digital asset offering in the future, in a highly-scalable and
efficient manner.

Mercari will deploy Harmonize, which is supported by IBM Cloud Hyper Protect
Services[1]. This setup will allow Mercari to scale to millions of wallets,
while maintaining control over private keys for risk management and ensuring
that keys are securely stored on local infrastructure in Australia. IBM’s
Digital Asset Infrastructure is designed to help custodians achieve greater
results when using METACO’s Harmonize platform, including enhanced
scalability, security, and compliance.

IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Crypto Services is designed to enable METACO Vaults to
store encrypted keys externally in a database while affording the protections
of IBM’s FIPS 140-2 Level 4 rated hardware security modules (HSM). With
external storage of keys enabled by IBM’s master encryption key technology,
custodians can scale to billions of wallets. The sensitive processing on
METACO Harmonize is secured by IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Virtual Servers
hardware-based, Common Criteria-certified isolation. IBM Cloud Hyper Protect
Secure Build Server is designed to reduce risks of malicious code insertion
during Harmonize deployments and address unauthorized rule manipulation by
working to make policies on the platform tamper proof. Irrespective of how
Harmonize is consumed, custodians retain physical control of the root of trust
of the assets and the policies that govern management of the assets, through
the IBM HSM Smartcards.

140-2 Level 4 hardware security module, Hyper Protect Virtual Services
featuring Common Criteria Evaluation Assurance Level 5+ logical partition
isolation, and IBM Hyper Protect Secure Build Server for CI/CD

**Patrick Enjalbal, Managing Director APAC at METACO,  commented:**

> _“Australia is a growing hub for digital assets in APAC with the Australian
> Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) recently setting out a crypto policy
> roadmap on the asset class. We’re proud to partner with Mercari, a_
> _regulated and innovative exchange, to support engagement with the asset
> class in Australia. Our platform, Harmonize, provides institutional grade
> security and governance for the custody of crypto assets, while ensuring the
> requisite flexibility and agility for innovators like Mercari to go-to-
> market and scale quickly.”_

Licensed as an electronic derivatives exchange since 2005 Mercari has been a
leading innovator in the development of financial market infrastructure for
wholesale derivatives markets and was the first licensed electronic swaps
marketplace to operate in Australia.

**Brian Price, director of Mercari commented** :

> _“As a leading regulated derivatives marketplace we recognise that when the
> legislative frameworks both in Australia and internationally are ultimately
> settled there will be a requirement for new and structurally appropriate
> institutional product solutions for the crypto class of assets.”_

**Price added:**

> _“Our work with strategic partners such as Metaco and IBM Cloud will help
> ensure that Mercari maintains a standard of excellence commensurate with the
> most stringent of true institutional use case expectations. We are
> anticipating that without ultra-high grade domestic institutional digital
> asset custody the industry will struggle to attract wide based internal
> compliance and regulatory support.”_

METACO, the leading technology provider in the digital asset ecosystem, has
significant implementations with Tier 1 banks, exchanges and other financial
institutions. Its platform, Harmonize, delivers the most secure, compliant and
flexible custody solution in the market, in combination with the end-to-end,
secure orchestration of workflows and governance processes across the entire
digital asset stack, with no single point of compromise.
