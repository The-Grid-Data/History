#### Lausanne, Switzerland – 07 February 2023 —

[Metaco](https://www.metaco.com/), the market-leading provider of mission-
critical digital asset custody and orchestration technology to global
financial and non-financial institutions, has appointed a number of key new
executives to its leadership team, to address increased demand for
institutional digital asset services, while expanding its addressable market
within and beyond the banking industry.

Former global Head of Digital Asset Infrastructure at IBM, [Peter
DeMeo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterdemeo/), joins the company as Chief
Product Officer, overseeing the product roadmap planning and lifecycle
execution of Metaco’s suite of software and infrastructure solutions for
institutions, and also responsible for setting up the company’s digital asset
advisory practice which provides strategic direction and consulting to the
business and to its clients. Having created IBM’s digital asset key management
practice going back to 2017, DeMeo brings deep domain expertise to the company
in digital asset key management and holds patents for hardened, policy based
crypto transaction signing and quantum-safe offline cloud cold storage.

Adding to DeMeo’s expertise in Metaco’s executive team is former IBM lead
architect, [Angel Nunez Mencias](https://www.linkedin.com/in/angelnume/) who
joins as Chief Customer Officer. Nunez Mencias, a prolific inventor and
multiple patent owner, oversaw two decades of software enterprise design at
the computing giant, including managing the development of its Hyper Protect
Cloud services.

Metaco continues to experience sustained growth from financial institutions,
corporates and startups for its services. Over the past 12 months it has
trebled its headcount in order to scale delivery and ensure customer success
across the globe. Appointments across the domains of computing, banking,
fintech and digital assets include [Katrin
Koller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katrinkoller/?originalSubdomain=ch),
former executive for Digital Assets at Accenture[1], as Head of Advisory;
[Rebecca Aspler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebecca-aspler/), former
blockchain product manager at PayPal and Unbound Security, as Head of Product;
and [Mei Li Powell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/meilipowell/) as Global Head
of Marketing & Communications, who brings an in-depth understanding of the
needs and client servicing models across the transaction services industry
gained over three decades in senior, global roles at Citi and Euroclear.

**[Adrien Treccani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/atreccani/), CEO and Founder
of Metaco, commented:**

> “ _We’re proud to appoint executives from leading companies in the
> computing, blockchain, financial services and consultancy industries to the
> leadership team. Metaco continues to grow at pace, supporting financial and
> non-financial institutions with infrastructure for a future in which every
> asset will be represented on-chain. These additions to our team will ensure
> that we continue to scale effectively and develop our solutions to meet the
> unprecedented levels of institutional demand we face, from regulated top-
> tier banks to corporates across all industries who wish to embed digital
> assets into their products and services._ ”

**Peter DeMeo, Chief Product Officer at Metaco, commented** ,

> _“I am thrilled to join Metaco at such a pivotal time in the growth of the
> company. The digital asset industry is undergoing a paradigm shift,
> underpinned by new security and compliance standards, driven by established
> financial institutions working closely with regulators worldwide. Metaco is
> playing a crucial role in supporting these institutions to bridge
> traditional finance and digital assets. Our purpose built infrastructure for
> complex digital asset use-cases supports business operating models
> characterized by the maximum possible levels of security and regulatory
> compliance.”_

In addition to bolstering its executive team, Metaco has invested in key
personnel across research and development, engineering and customer services
to ensure the continued implementation of industry-leading custody solutions
and fulfill customer and growth ambitions. As part of its commitment to
innovation and servicing institutional needs, the company is creating Metaco
Labs, a new research and development unit which is being led by Chief Customer
Officer, Angel Nunez Mencias. Among his first innovation priorities, Nunez
Mencias will oversee the commercialization of Metaco’s recently developed
proprietary multi-party computation (MPC) key management solution, while
continuing to work with strategic partners and top-tier banks to integrate MPC
key shards natively in hardware security modules. This will deliver the
highest degree of security, scalability and flexibility in institutional
custody, strengthening Metaco’s differentiating position in the market as the
only custody technology platform able to combine the best of multi-party
computation and hardware security to decentralize risk and minimize attack
surfaces.
