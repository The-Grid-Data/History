The last 12 months have been a riveting time at Metaco. Our company has
reached major milestones – forming new exciting partnerships and continued
growth in providing infrastructure for financial institutions to securely
manage digital assets.

Today, we enter the next pivotal period in our global expansion. We have
successfully raised $17 million in our Series A funding round this July. In a
turbulent economic climate, we are proud to have an oversubscribed round, with
double the demand of our initial target. This round represents continued
support from existing investors combined with significant interest from new
strategic partners in security technology, central bank infrastructure, Swiss
and global banks, and venture firms focused on financial technology.

[Giesecke+Devrient](https://www.gi-de.com/), the German-based security
technology company and one of the main central bank infrastructure partners,
led the round.[ Standard Chartered Bank](https://www.sc.com/),[ Zürcher
Kantonalbank](https://www.zkb.ch/), and venture capital firm[
Investiere](https://www.investiere.ch/) joined the round, which also saw all
existing strategic shareholders,[ Swisscom](https://www.swisscom.ch/),[
SICPA](https://www.sicpa.com/),[ Avaloq
Ventures](https://www.avaloq.one/avaloqventures), and[ Swiss
Post](https://www.post.ch/en) increase their commitments.

Our ability to expand notable Swiss strategic partnerships to new global
partnerships in this round, is a significant endorsement of our growth
internationally, as well as a demonstration of rising institutional interest
in digital assets.

Launched in 2018, our institutional operating system for digital assets,[
SILO](https://www.metaco.com/platform/harmonize/), enables large financial
institutions to securely integrate cryptocurrencies, tokens, and distributed
ledger use cases into their core infrastructure. Its unique framework for
digital asset custody, transaction management, trading, and tokenization has
made it the leading choice for banks and exchanges. METACO has significant
Tier 1 and Tier 2 bank implementations including FINMA, BaFin, Banco de
España, ECB, and MAS regulated banks and exchanges.

**Commenting on the raise, Adrien Treccani, CEO and Founder of METACO, said,**

> “ _I am really proud of our team and this funding round will push us to new
> heights. METACO not only secured an impressive round of funding, but also_
> _has_  _a number of significant partnerships and integrations coming down
> the pipeline. I look forward to working with our new shareholders and
> encourage companies to get in touch to explore possible synergies_.”

The Series A funding will fuel the next phase in our growth in sales, product,
and partnerships. We will be broadening our presence in the US, South East
Asia, and Western Europe. Research and development are at the core of our
business strategy, so we will increase investment in R&D to cement our
position as the leader in digital asset infrastructure. We will also be
expanding our product and addressable market with the launch of a fully
managed, secure, and cloud-based offering, SILO, that will open up the
solution to the entire institutional market.

**Assaf Shamia, Investment Director at  Giesecke+Devrient, said,**

> “ _The tokenization narrative is gaining momentum among regulators and
> central banks, encompassing a broad spectrum of promising innovations
> ranging from digital currencies to national identities. Yet tokenized assets
> require a trusted, secure, and scalable solution to handle the safeguarding
> of private keys. Following extensive market research, we identified METACO
> as the dominant player in its field. This large funding round, completed
> during a period of notable market uncertainty, is a significant milestone
> for METACO and will allow the company to accelerate its global growth and
> anchor its position as a category leader in the crypto-custody market.”_

**Alex Manson, Global Head of  SC Ventures, the innovation, fintech investment
and venture arm of Standard Chartered, added,**

>  “ _We believe that digital assets are here to stay as an asset class.
> However, the infrastructure is still very nascent. We are developing a
> venture to meet the demands of institutional investors for an end-to-end
> institutional grade custodian of digital assets, which meets regulatory
> standards. We are pleased to partner and invest in METACO, as a leading
> provider of security-critical digital asset infrastructure, which will
> provide both ease of use and uncompromising security_.”

This round represents the next important step in realizing our vision,
ensuring that we continue to make progress in our mission to transform the
financial services industry.
