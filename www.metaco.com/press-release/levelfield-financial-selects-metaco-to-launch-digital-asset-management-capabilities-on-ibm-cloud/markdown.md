#### **Lausanne, Switzerland and Houston, TX, USA — May 26, 2022  **

[**LevelField Financial**](https://www.levelfield.us/), the premier U.S.
financial services firm uniting digital assets and traditional banking
services in one trusted platform has selected
[**METACO**](https://www.metaco.com/), the market-leading provider of digital
asset custody orchestration technology to complex, global financial
institutions. LevelField is deploying its institutional digital asset
management operations on [**IBM Cloud**](https://www.ibm.com/cloud) in order
to leverage the confidential computing capabilities of IBM’s digital asset
infrastructure.

Founded by banking executives with decades of global experience, LevelField is
in the process of acquiring a federally chartered bank in the United States.
To launch its digital asset offering, LevelField will use METACO’s digital
asset custody and orchestration platform,
[**Harmonize**](https://www.metaco.com/platform/harmonize/), helping enable
clients to securely store, trade, and settle digital assets. Harmonize was
built in partnership with Tier 1 banks and offers the highest standards of
security and compliance for LevelField to operate in the digital assets
sector. This foundational infrastructure provides LevelField with the option
to further expand its digital asset offering in the future, in a highly-
scalable and efficient manner.

LevelField will deploy Harmonize, which is supported by IBM Cloud Hyper
Protect Services[1]. This setup will allow LevelField to scale to millions of
wallets, while maintaining control over private keys for risk management.
IBM’s Digital Asset Infrastructure is designed to help custodians achieve
greater results when using METACO’s Harmonize platform, including enhanced
scalability, security, and compliance.

IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Crypto Services is designed to enable METACO Vaults to
store encrypted keys externally in a database while affording the protections
of IBM’s FIPS 140-2 Level 4 rated hardware security modules (HSM). With
external storage of keys enabled by IBM’s master encryption key technology,
custodians can scale to billions of wallets. The sensitive processing on
METACO Harmonize is secured by IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Virtual Servers
hardware-based, Common Criteria-certified isolation. IBM Cloud Hyper Protect
Secure Build Server is designed to reduce risks of malicious code insertion
during Harmonize deployments and address unauthorized rule manipulation by
working to make policies on the platform tamper proof. Irrespective of how
Harmonize is consumed, custodians retain physical control of the root of trust
of the assets and the policies that govern management of the assets, through
the IBM HSM Smartcards.

[**Seamus Donoghue**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/seamus-
donoghue-2504115a/?originalSubdomain=ch)**, VP of Strategic Alliances at
METACO commented** ,

> “ _We’re pleased to support LevelField in realizing its vision of uniting
> digital assets with traditional finance to create the most trusted banking
> platform of the future. Harmonize provides bank-grade security and
> compliance for the custody and management of digital assets, as well as the
> agility for innovative firms like LevelField to go-to-market and scale
> quickly. With a flexible governance policy framework that can be applied to
> any type of digital asset transaction, a no-single-point-of-failure model,
> and the optionality to expand and offer any type of digital asset services,
> Harmonize provides a highly secure and flexible foundation for LevelField to
> manage its digital asset operations, both today and well into the future._ ”

Established in Houston in 2018, and currently pending a banking charter,
LevelField aims to blend digital banking, securities, and digital assets to
provide a comprehensive banking service for the digital economy. The firm is
building a customer- focused financial services platform for digital and
traditional assets that leverages the strengths of the U.S. banking system, is
built on a solid foundation of regulatory compliance, and draws on its
management team’s expertise across traditional banking.

**[Michael Clayton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelwilliamclayton/), CTO,
LevelField _,  _commented**,

> “ _LevelField is comprised of career bankers who deeply understand the
> importance of compliance and security. We searched for the platform that
> would enable us to meet our rigorous standards for security and compliance,
> while also giving us the flexibility to grow our digital asset business in
> any direction. METACO’s Harmonize orchestration platform, supported by IBM
> Cloud Hyper Protect Services, is the ideal solution and something which may
> become the gold-standard in the industry. This infrastructure enables us to
> demonstrate our compliance and the highest levels of security no matter what
> area of digital assets we expand into_.”

METACO, the leading technology provider in the digital asset ecosystem, has
significant implementations with Tier 1 banks, exchanges and other financial
institutions. Its platform, Harmonize, delivers the most secure, compliant and
flexible custody solution in the market, in combination with the end-to-end,
secure orchestration of workflows and governance processes across the entire
digital asset stack, with no single point of compromise.
