Despite the headline narrative around ‘crypto winters’, the developments
around the application of distributed ledger technology (DLT) and
cryptocurrencies have started to diverge in the last couple of years. This is
especially true with the institutional adoption of DLT and the tokenization of
assets such as bonds, securities and other off-chain assets also popularly
referred to as real-world assets (RWAs).

Real world assets like stocks, bonds, real estate, and others can be tokenized
on blockchains with improved efficiencies over traditional market
infrastructure. And DLT is increasingly about creating the flexibility of
choice in operating models — not dictating specific features as mandatory,
thereby democratizing ownership of a wide variety of assets to a much wider
segment.
