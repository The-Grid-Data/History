## The Imperative for Banks to **Invest in Digital Asset Custody
Infrastructure**

Digital assets (otherwise known as crypto assets, virtual assets, or tokens)
refer to any form of value or ownership that exists in a digital or electronic
format, represented and recorded on a blockchain or distributed ledger, making
them secure, transparent, and tamper resistant. As these assets continue to
mature, institutional investors and financial organizations are increasingly
interested in entering the digital asset market. While regulatory
uncertainties persist, the long-term implication is evident: digital assets
are increasingly becoming an essential part of the financial ecosystem.

However, the unique nature of digital assets requires specialized custody
solutions to safeguard these assets while enabling market activity. Banks and
other financial institutions have a unique opportunity to capitalize on this
growth by investing in digital asset custody infrastructure, expanding their
core business to new markets underpinned by new asset classes. Institutional
digital asset custody is therefore a crucial aspect of the emerging digital
asset ecosystem, and it is defined by several key tenets that institutions
must adhere to in order to securely manage and protect their digital assets.
