Welcome to episode #2 of  [**METACO bytes**  ](https://www.metaco.com/metaco-
bytes/)– a series of videos facilitating byte-sized insights aimed at creating
an unfair advantage to people operating at the intersection of technology,
innovation and crypto.

In this episode, **Nicolas DORIER** , co-founder and VP of Digital Currencies
at METACO, explains the concept of **Taproot**  – a major Bitcoin (BTC)
upgrade, and one of its largest alterations, taking the form of a soft-fork
that will probably happen in 2021.
