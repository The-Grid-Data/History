# Learnings from The Network Forum in 2022: Custodians respond to demand for
digital asset services

In 2022, Metaco partnered with The Network Forum (TNF), the global community
for the custody, settlement and post-trade industry, to support TNF’s Global
Annual Meeting and the regional events across Abu Dhabi, Singapore and New
York. Below are some of our learnings from these events with regards to how
custodian institutions and securities services firms approach the digital
asset market opportunity. We look forward to continuing these discussions with
industry participants, as we extend our partnership with TNF into 2023.

With digital assets becoming increasingly institutionalized, global custodians
have taken note, and are looking for ways to support investors in this fast
growing market. So how is the industry responding?

### Digital assets lay the foundations for the future

A unified theme across all regions was that although crypto currencies are the
most well-known and widely traded of all of the digital assets, the universe
of digital assets is very diverse. In addition to digital coins (i.e. crypto
currencies, stable coins, Central Bank Digital Currencies), the industry is
equally interested in tokens, which are digital representation of a financial
asset (i.e. an equity security, bond, commodity, etc.) or a non-financial
asset (e.g. art, real estate, IP, etc.) that can be traded using distributed
ledger technology (DLT)-based infrastructure, and which is subject to existing
securities regulations. Tokens can also be sub-divided into smaller units,
making investing more accessible – especially for ordinary consumers.

Although some institutions have largely avoided crypto currencies for a
variety of reasons, most are still open to the idea of investing and
interacting with this asset class. But the longer term, bigger opportunity
lies in regulated digital securities. Aside from being a new source of
investment returns, institutions see tokens – in particular – as being an
effective risk diversifier. Accordingly, the pulse of the event participants,
as well as research reports, suggest that the token market will enjoy healthy
growth over the next few years.

### A market moving in an institutional direction

Historically, investors have leveraged the services of so called crypto-native
companies – otherwise known as ‘ _Wave One’_ firms – when trading crypto
currencies. In many instances, these companies – overwhelmingly startups –
will safekeep, mainly in hot wallet storage facilities, investors’ private
keys, which ultimately enable them to access their crypto currency holdings.

> “Private key management is the responsibility of investors. In theory,
> investors can hold private keys on their mobile phones, but this carries
> obvious risks, which is why they often prefer to rely on trusted, regulated
> third parties”

commented Seamus Donoghue, Chief Growth Officer at Metaco.

Although many retail investors are happy to use crypto native firms,
institutions are less so. Thirty-eight percent (38%) of institutional
investors told a study by Fidelity Digital Assets that they had concerns about
the security of the safekeeping arrangements at existing crypto providers,
adding this was a barrier precluding them from entering into the digital asset
market. A number of _‘Wave One’_ providers in the crypto space have suffered
their fair share of scandals, including high-profile hacks,  security
compromises and internal collusion, and this presents a big barrier for
further institutional adoption.

In addition, a survey of buy-side firms from Coalition Greenwich (part of S&P
Global) concludes that the current digital asset custody marketplace is _sub-
scale and not mature_ , which makes family offices, hedge funds and asset
managers, among others, to continue to self-custody their clients’ digital
assets, despite all the inherent risks. Larger investors stated that their
preference is to use **a multi-custodian or even a mixed approach,** such as a
combination of self-custody and third party custodians due to the breadth of
investments they plan to make in the space.

These deficiencies have created an opening for custodians, whose regulated
nature, sizeable balance sheets, extensive industry expertise in servicing
traditional assets, and global networks, put them in an excellent position to
help clients navigate the nascent digital asset universe. In Singapore, DBS
Bank has pioneered its institutional-grade, multi-coin digital asset custody
service, DBS Digital Exchange, through fully air-gapped cold storage
technology, which has been fully operational since August 2021.

The sudden and spectacular collapse of FTX is also likely to play into the
hands of custodians developing digital asset custody solutions, as
institutions trading crypto take a more refined approach towards risk
management. A speaker from a tier one financial institution at TNF in
Singapore says institutions are now tightening the screws on standalone crypto
custodians following recent events, especially as allegations of comingling of
client assets come to surface. Another speaker from a European bank notes that
network managers at global custodians and broker-dealers will need to adapt
and develop different skillsets when conducting due diligences on crypto
custodians versus traditional agent banks.

The revenue opportunities available through digital asset custody are also
highly attractive for traditional incumbents. Profit margins and returns on
digital asset custody are likely to still be four to six times higher than in
the traditional asset space, making the digital asset business case very
attractive to existing incumbents, an idea voiced across all four events of
2022.

### Getting the technology right

Crypto currencies laid the foundation for the technology which will be used to
support issuance, storage, trading and settlement of digital assets more
widely. Irrespective of whether crypto currencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum
rise or fall, the common view is that the core technology infrastructure
underpinning these assets has a strong future ahead of it.

If banks are to thrive and attract institutional mandates, their crypto
custody solutions will need to be sufficiently agile, but also highly secure.
Nonetheless, custodians looking to enter the digital asset market do face
constraints of their own, especially around technology.

> “If banks are to succeed in the digital asset world, they will need to
> reinvent their technology stack, and shift away from legacy systems.”

commented Seamus Donoghue.

Technology change programs of this nature and size can be complex, which could
pose problems for custodians, especially as they will need to navigate a
number of intricacies when operating crypto custody solutions in different
markets, as the regulations, key storage and data requirements across multiple
jurisdictions will often vary. This is something, which will ultimately need
to be managed.

> “In response, more tier one banks are now turning to external technology
> platforms such as Metaco, which have the infrastructure and expertise to
> help custodians go to market with digital asset custody solutions in a way
> that is fast, safe and compliant.”

reiterated Donoghue.

This is echoed by Johannes Kaske, Global Head of Solutions at Metaco during
TNF in Abu Dhabi:

> “Banks recognize that they are not technology companies, so they are looking
> to cooperate with specialized software infrastructure providers when
> implementing solutions around digital assets. Banks bring a level of
> expertise around regulation and compliance, while technology firms have
> extensive experience in areas such as blockchain, applied cryptography and
> digital assets. Through cooperation between the two, banks can create the
> foundational infrastructure of tomorrow’s financial markets.”
