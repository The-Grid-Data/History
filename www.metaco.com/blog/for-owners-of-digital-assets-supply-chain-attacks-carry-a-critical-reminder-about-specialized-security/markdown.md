_This article is an extract from a recent METACO white paper titled “[Supply
Chain Attacks Highlight the Fundamental Importance of Digital Asset
Security](https://www.metaco.com/resources/whitepapers/)“,_ which contains
crowdsourced insights from cybersecurity experts _Costin G. RAIU, Juan Andrés
Guerrero-Saade, Eliza May Austin and Chris Kubecka._

—————————

Similar to data breaches, supply chain attacks carry a compound risk with
exponential impact on the tech ecosystem and beyond. As you are reading this,
cybercriminals are working to corroborate the data they harvest from their
victims with existing information, getting it ready to launch subsequent
attacks which are harder to detect.

The more adversaries find out about their victims and the interconnected
players in its environment, the better they can target any of them.

As a consequence… “ _the private sector’s aggregated risk from software supply
chain compromises  [continues to grow](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-
depth-research-reports/report/breaking-trust-shades-of-crisis-across-an-
insecure-software-supply-chain/).”_

We are past the point where the financial and reputational impact is the most
serious consequence. The fallout of a major supply chain attack now also
includes instability – both in the business world and in international
politics – which are inherently intertwined.

> _“What I’m afraid of is that – looking at the future – the erosion of trust
> caused by supply chain attacks and malicious updates has the potential to be
> even more damaging than the attacks themselves.”  __**–  [Costin G.
> RAIU](https://twitter.com/craiu), ****Director of the Global Research and
> Analysis Team at Kaspersky**_

With [digital assets coming of age](https://www.metaco.com/digital-assets-are-
coming-of-age/) and [shedding their stigma](https://www.metaco.com/the-
changing-face-of-cryptocurrencies-from-crime-conduit-to-currency-of-choice/)
to become a reliable category of financial assets, they are bound to become a
magnet for malicious actors. The bigger the payoff at the end of their
compromise attempt, the more incisive their actions will be.

That is why supply chain security is crucial for sponsoring trust and
cultivating the lasting credibility that digital assets deserve.

### The risk of not prioritizing supply chain attacks

As a cybersecurity specialist, I know that supply chain attacks are inevitable
but also that their impact can – and should – be thoroughly mitigated. It’s up
to every organization to decide how much of its budget goes to cybersecurity
and how much risk it’s willing to sustain as “the cost of doing business.”

In financial terms, the effects of a supply chain attack can be daunting. The
SolarWinds compromise [cost the company $3.5
million](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/solarwinds-
reports-35-million-in-expenses-from-supply-chain-attack/) in December 2020
alone, with ongoing legal and investigative costs to follow and span over
months – even years.

The TNT division of FedEx and Maersk each spent [around $300
million](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-41336086) to repair and rebuild
their IT infrastructure after NotPetya, which also took a heavy financial toll
on several other companies. Maersk had to reinstall “4,000 servers, 45,000
PCs, and 2500 applications over the course of ten days in late June and early
July 2017”, [an
operation](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/maersk-
reinstalled-45-000-pcs-and-4-000-servers-to-recover-from-notpetya-attack/) of
almost unimaginable amplitude and complexity. And the Danish shipping company
wasn’t even the main target of the attack – just collateral damage.

In another example, BlackEnergy 3, the compromise of [the Ukrainian power
grid](https://ics.sans.org/media/E-ISAC_SANS_Ukraine_DUC_5.pdf), “caused
approximately 225,000 customers to lose power across various areas” of the
country. Even worse, [Stuxnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet) targeted
Iran’s nuclear program with a type of malicious behavior that was unusual and
highly focused.

Supply chain attacks are not only dangerous because of their immediate impact
but also because of their deep implications that concern every company out
there – a statement that doesn’t carry an ounce of exaggeration.

> _“Supply chain attacks have been a long-standing bogeyman in the security
> space, with a lot of the concern focused on the perception of hardware
> supply chain vulnerability due to a shift towards foreign manufacturing of
> important components.  _
>
> _The past six years have emphasized the greater indiscriminate impact of
> software supply chains – and just how vulnerable most organizations are when
> it comes to the integrity of the software they rely on.  _
>
> _Whether it’s trojanized legitimate applications, backdoored dependencies,
> or benign software being served malicious updates, attackers have turned
> legitimate software from well-meaning software suppliers into an entry point
> to customer networks.  _
>
> _At the end of the day, this phase of supply chain attacks emphasizes the
> importance of moving beyond reputational trust towards actively monitoring
> endpoints to determine software integrity over time.”  __**–  ****[Juan

> Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS)**_

### Long-term implications of a supply chain attack

Besides fueling the underground economy with troves of data and intelligence
about companies, governments, and individuals, supply chain attacks have
numerous consequences that keep accumulating.

One of them is the long road to recovery an organization has to go through
once it’s been hit. From investigating weaknesses in software, hardware, and
even business processes to patching vulnerabilities, restoring data from
backups, and rebuilding entire IT systems, rehabilitation takes colossal
effort and resources.

> _“The long-term consequences organizations don’t factor in until disaster
> strikes include several elements.  _
>
> _First, can the organization patch or update technology associated with the
> supply chain issue? Example, older tech builds on specific programming
> languages which could potentially cost millions to upgrade the digital
> ecosystem of the organization.  _
>
> _Another factor is who is ultimately liable. Would it be the organization
> who must pay fines such as those brought on by the EU GDPR and associated
> costs or would it be the supply-chain that caused a breach?  _
>
> _Another concern is answering the question: can the supplier be switched to
> another, more secure option without increasing costs substantially?”  __**–

### The rise and mass uptake of digital assets incentivizes motivated
attackers

Malicious actors are very well versed in finding creative ways to exploit
weaknesses in systems, whether we’re talking about software or human nature.
While security specialists deal with a bombardment of issues, cybercriminals
look for that one vulnerability that gives them a way in and a chance to
undermine their defenses.

In reality, there is no right way to mitigate a supply chain attack, no
perfect playbook to rely on.

Layered defense is the only viable strategy along with strong cooperation
between stakeholders in the organization and their technology partners,
including law enforcement. Hardware and software security, business processes,
and cybersecurity training for all employees are all elements decision-makers
need to orchestrate.

This principle is even more important in digital asset management, where
keeping the private key safe is fundamental. You could say it’s our most
important job.

That is why, at **METACO** , we combine digital and physical countermeasures
in [tailored, scalable security setups](https://www.metaco.com/the-blueprint-
for-tailored-security-at-scale-in-digital-asset-management/).

Besides a multi-layered approach, segmenting networks of individual
components, leveraging trusted/confidential computing principles, and
compartmentalizing workloads are essential elements for implementing defense
in depth. This reliable security practice helps keep things contained and
reduces the impact of a cyberattack.

Another option of architecting a [zero trust
network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_trust_networks) which assumes that
networked devices (e.g. laptops, desktop computers, smartphones, etc.) are not
trusted by default, forcing them to authenticate every time and prove their
identity and integrity.

What adds to the challenge in digital asset management is that standardization
and transparency are lacking in this space. Competition makes collaboration
difficult at this stage, as most organizations are trying to carve their path
in this relatively new field.

As responsible specialists, we should be keenly aware that attackers take
advantage of this fragmentation. In digital asset security, where customers
potentially have millions – if not billions – in crypto assets, cybercriminals
have a strong incentive to hack their way into systems to steal the master
key, no matter the cost. If they have to pay someone $1 million just to
pretend they are an HVAC repairman, they will do so because the reward is
worth it.

That is why, when you start adding digital assets to your financial inventory,
you need to ensure you work with a technology partner that is keenly aware of
supply chain risks and that is actively mitigating them.

### A reminder for owners of digital assets

One of the threats that digital asset owners have is tied to how they access
and manage this category of assets, particularly crypto.

As mentioned, attacks targeting app stores are advancing both in volume and
sophistication. Concretely, malicious actors use app distribution platforms to
spread malware either by designing apps that appear to be legitimate or by
infiltrating compromised code into bona fide applications. This is why we
advise against managing crypto assets with apps from these platforms.

It’s elements like these that have a compound effect on digital asset
security. Given the breadth, depth, and dynamic of the sector, ensuring
defense in depth, especially against supply chain attacks, is a  highly
demanding task for internal teams.

The option of working with a security provider with deep expertise around
digital assets can turn out to be not just more cost-effective but also more
dependable. We have seen first-hand how financial institutions and other large
organizations have effectively harmonized their digital asset operations.
Rather than trying to secure wallets and private keys themselves, they were
able to build or improve their ability to secure, trade, issue and manage
digital assets by choosing**  METACO**. Besides expertise and technology, they
also got the proficiency of our integration team.

### Preventing supply chain attacks – a shared responsibility

To architect security improvements designed for the long-term, we must start
from the concept of shared responsibility. It is also crucial that we keep
supply chain attacks at the top of the agenda in conversations between
business and technology decision-makers. In our view, it all starts from a
shared understanding of the risks involved, the potential consequences, and
the inherent limits everyone is operating within the current tech paradigm.

We echo the call launched by [The Atlantic
Council](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-
reports/report/breaking-trust-shades-of-crisis-across-an-insecure-software-
supply-chain/) to forge “new alliance models and operational collaboration.”

We also actively contribute to advancing talks about digital asset security
through educational content, such as our glossary, the [METACO
talks](https://www.metaco.com/resources/podcasts/), bytes, and insights. When
working with our customers, we run workshops that help establish common
grounds in terms of concepts we operate with in digital asset management and
their implications. It is our goal to support them in making decisions for
their organizations but also enable them to pass on clear, practical
information to their peers and respective connections.

Looking at digital assets through the lens of an attacker can be eye-opening,
so I hope you will take this opportunity to consider including the supply
chain in your response and remediation plan for cyberattacks.
