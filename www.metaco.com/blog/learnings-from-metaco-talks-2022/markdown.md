# Learnings from Metaco Talks in 2022: Digital assets continue to gather
momentum, despite one-off challenges

2022 was a mixed year for digital assets across the spectrum. Firstly, the
cryptocurrency market suffered a severe downturn due to challenging macro
headwinds – namely soaring inflation and rising interest rates. This was
exacerbated by the collapse of the Terra USD stablecoin and a succession of
bankruptcies involving crypto lenders and crypto-focused hedge funds. The
shock failure of FTX – a one-time leading crypto exchange – only deepened the
sense of crisis facing crypto. However, the strong appetite for digital assets
remained – particularly focused on security tokens, prompting leading
traditional banks to develop solutions which can support these new financial
instruments. Metaco conducted a series of podcasts and webinars in 2022 with a
diverse range of guests from leading banks, tech firms and consultancies. So
what were the main discussion points?

### Crypto faces some tough – but not insurmountable – challenges ahead

The spectacular failure of FTX in November 2022 and the subsequent charging of
its founder with fraud has created a crisis of confidence in cryptocurrency
circles. The demise of FTX coincided with the downfall of several other high-
profile crypto exchanges, lenders and hedge funds, concluding what has been a
defining moment for the crypto native world, with the crypto currencies market
capitalization slipping from a $3 trillion peak in 2021 to $798 billion at the
end of 2022.

While some financial institutions have largely avoided crypto currencies for a
variety of reasons, most are still open to the idea of investing and
interacting with this asset class. But the longer term, bigger opportunity
lies in regulated digital securities. Aside from being a new source of
investment returns, institutions see tokens – in particular – as being an
effective risk diversifier. Accordingly, the pulse of the event participants,
as well as research reports, suggest that the token market will enjoy healthy
growth over the next few years, with HSBC and Northern Trust estimating that
between [5% – 10% of all assets could be tokenized by
2030](https://www.northerntrust.com/united-states/insights-
research/2023/cis/beyond-asset-tokenisation) – that represents a $20 trillion
market opportunity in the near-term.

> _“FTX is a disaster for the crypto industry, for the crypto fintechs, for
> regulators, and for end-clients. It is harming the overall public opinions
> about the industry –   but that does not mean that crypto is dead,”_
>
> according to [Jan Rosam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/janrosam/), Partner,
> Technology Consulting & EMEIA Consulting Lead for Digital Assets & Digital
> Currencies at **EY**.

Although the market capitalization of cryptocurrencies has taken a significant
dent, [Jose Antonio Colomer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jos%C3%A9-antonio-
colomer-rosa-caia-824bb920/), Head of Blockchain and Digital Offering at
**BBVA** , suggested the asset class should not be written off entirely.

> _“Some people would say that crypto is still a very small market. I’m not
> sure about that, because not long ago, the market size was $3 trillion,
> which if compared to the S &P is very small. But if it is compared with the
> gold market, then crypto was about a fourth of the size.”_

He continued that even after the crypto winter, the asset class still had a
market capitalization which was greater than that of J.P. Morgan and Visa.

> _“I think in terms of the state of the ecosystem, we are in a place similar
> to where the internet was in the 1990s. There you need to look at adoption.
> Today we have over 200 million users in crypto, which is about what we had
> using the internet in 1999 or so. Today the internet has 4.6 billion users.
> What does that mean for crypto in terms of what we can have in a few years,
> and also what does it mean for where the market cap of crypto could be in 10
> or 15 years? If you believe in this narrative, the opportunity is huge.”_
>
> added Colomer.

Nonetheless, it is clear that there will need to be some sort of regulation or
oversight of cryptocurrencies if the market’s fortunes are to recover.

> _“It really appears that we as humans cannot self-regulate. It has
> unfortunately been shown time and again. After Terra USD, Three Arrows
> Capital and now FTX, it is clear that regulation is inevitable,”_
>
> pointed out [Kelly Chia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kellychia/), Deputy
> Head of Research Asia at Bank **Julius Baer.**

Regulation of digital assets – including cryptocurrencies – is already in
motion across a number of leading global markets.

> _“We have seen the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MICA) in the EU,
> while the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and Securities and Futures
> Commission (SFC) have published detailed circulars regarding the framework
> that financial institutions must implement in terms of their operating
> model,”_
>
> said [Adrien Barquissau](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrien-
> barquissau-6924ab24/), Director at **Synpulse Hong Kong**.

In fact, Hong Kong’s authorities have since announced that crypto-exchanges
will be subject to the same antimoney laundering and terrorist financing
rules, as traditional financial institutions from June 2023.

### CBDCs , NFTs, and tokens gather momentum

Outside of cryptocurrencies, CBDCs, namely digital fiat money issued by
Central Banks,  are generating interest in institutional and retail circles,
as they could potentially expedite cross-border payments and settlements.

> _“I strongly believe that we will have a CBDC one day, sooner rather than
> later. The European Central Bank (ECB)   has made multiple announcements
> related to the digital Euro prototype, with the goal potentially to deliver
> a true digital Euro by 2025. It is pretty short term when you think about
> it, especially when you consider the impact it could have on the financial
> markets, but also on things like cross border payments and retail payments.
> Again, the needs are there; either for a wholesale CBDC, meaning a CBDC
> which will apply to large cash transactions – especially in the banking
> sector; but also for a retail CBDC, which can support smaller payments.”_
>
> explained [Jean-Marc Stenger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jean-marc-
> stenger-89115040/), CEO at **Societe Generale – FORGE**.

Elsewhere, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are also gathering momentum, with crypto
enthusiasts spending more than $41 billion on them in 2021 alone. NFTs are
tokens which exist on a Blockchain and are digital representations of real
world assets. Already used extensively in the world of art and collectables,
NFTs are now permeating into luxury goods.

> _“NFTs for the luxury industry is a way to enable ownership and
> authentication or provenance, and transparency. We are able to use the
> digital certificates to prove the authenticity of the piece. But we are also
> able to prove the authenticity of the digital token, which is equally
> important. When we speak about ownership in terms of tokens, (we are talking
> about) a customer owning the digital certificate. But who has created this
> digital certificate is equally important. I say that because I am convinced
> that we are going to see a surge of counterfeiting in the digital realm.
> There will be counterfeiters creating fake NFTs.”_
>
> said [Pedro Lopez-Belmonte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/plberaso/),
> Blockchain Lead at **Richemont** , the Swiss-based luxury company,  and
> owner of Cartier, Montblanc and Net-a-porter.

In order to prevent counterfeiting in this burgeoning market, he highlighted
organizations need to educate customers about how NFTs work.

However, it is asset tokenization, which is eliciting the most excitement in
the banking world. Through tokenization, assets – including regulated
traditional securities (equities, bonds) and illiquid financial instruments
(i.e. real estate, private equity funds, commodities, fine wines, etc. ) can
be digitalized and fractionalized on a distributed ledger technology, making
them cheaper for retail investors to acquire. Not only will this democratize
investment, but it could help shore up liquidity in what are very illiquid
markets.

According to [Catherine Guay-
Chenard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/catherineguaychenard/), Subject Matter
Expert at Metaco, the market capitalization of tokenised assets is expected to
skyrocket to more than $20 trillion in the next few years, and could
potentially even exceed $350 trillion plus in the longer-term.

> _“Eventually the entire capital market could be moving on-chain for all
> kinds of assets.”_
>
> she stressed.

### Banks look to respond to the digital asset transformation

Banks are looking for ways by which to capitalize on the surging interest in
and demand for digital assets. If anything, the failure at FTX – along with a
number of other crypto exchanges, lenders and funds – has reinforced how
important it is for investors to engage the services of institutional and
regulated providers when participating in these markets. [Jan
Rosam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/janrosam/), Partner, Technology Consulting
& EMEIA Consulting Lead for Digital Assets & Digital Currencies at **EY** ,
underlined:

> “Clients will look for a much more trusted party in this business going
> forward. There is a big role to play for the banks.”

Nonetheless, he conceded that cryptocurrencies is not necessarily the main
priority area for many banks, and they do not want to necessarily support
activities like cryptocurrency trading, as the asset class is unregulated and
volatile. Additionally, Basel capital requirements for banks holding crypto
are likely to be very high,  potentially carrying a 1,250% risk weighting,
which will be another major deterrent. However, some banks – especially those
in emerging markets which are home to vast unbanked populations – are
increasingly recognizing the benefits of leveraging crypto assets, such as
stablecoins, as a means to facilitate greater financial inclusion.

> _“An estimated 65% of the population in APAC is unbanked,”_
>
> according to [Richard Swainston](https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-
> swainston-digital-assets/), Business Development Director at **Metaco**.

In 2019, **UnionBank of the Philippines** issued its own stablecoin – PHX –
which is pegged to the Philippine Peso and can provide automatic execution of
payments. It is being implemented on UnionBank’s I2i (island to island,
institution to institution and individual to individual) Blockchain-based
platform, which enables connectivity between rural banks in the country.

> _“The idea of PHX stems from two things. First of all, it was our desire to
> respond to the call of pushing for financial inclusion. The fact that not
> everyone has access to financial products or the right financial products
> for their needs has always been one of the pressing issues here in the
> Philippines, and probably in most developing markets.   We knew that in a
> country like the Philippines, with more than 7,100 islands, it is a bit
> difficult and not to mention costly, for banks like us to reach everyone in
> each of these islands. I think probably everyone knows by now that digital
> is key to this,”_
>
> explained [Catherine Bautista-
> Casas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cathy-c-57886339/), Head of the
> Blockchain Centre of Excellence, Digital Asset Markets at **UnionBank of the
> Philippines**.

However, the real opportunity for traditional financial institutions lies with
tokenization. Guay-Chenard said Tire 1 banks are currently leading the way in
terms of building up  digital asset custody solutions, adding they see
tokenization as a huge market opportunity. Custodians are certainly scoping
out ways to support tokenization.

> _“We need to build a common infrastructure. If we are embarking on a path
> where we are tokenizing real world assets, what is the infrastructure needed
> for that?”  _
>
> highlighted [Nitin Gaur](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nitin-gaur-75571a9/),
> Managing Director at **State Street Digital.**

With investors still reeling from the events at FTX and other high-profile
failures, many will be looking to incumbent custodians with strong balance
sheets and excellent risk and compliance controls to safeguard their private
keys. [Maximilian Ruf](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maximilianruf/) , Business
Solutions Consultant, Digital Assets and Web3 at Metaco, noted the first wave
of crypto-native providers are now making way for a second wave of
established, regualted institutional providers, including banks. He noted:

> _“We are seeing this paradigm shift from the first wave to the second wave,
> to the wave of established top tier regulated financial institutions who are
> building serious institutional grade market infrastructure.”_

### Security and agility

Despite the empowerment a Web3 environment could offer investors, experts
believe custodians will have an invaluable role to play in safekeeping digital
assets.

> _“Being your own bank is hard. The reason being your own bank is hard is
> because if you have ever tried to carry around all of your net worth, it is
> a little bit of a personal risk or a security threat. Banks and custodians
> play a useful role in society. They store the stuff that really matters to
> you in this one space, and will make sure it is not stolen. But the way
> custody works in Web3 is so powerful because it has created this global CRM
> of assets.“_
>
> said [Simon Taylor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sytaylor/), Head of Strategy
> and Content at **Sardine,** and co-founder at 11FS.

Banks also have the added advantage that they can support clients who are
trading traditional securities in parallel with digital assets.

> _“We do not look at digital assets as being different from traditional
> financial assets.”_
>
> acknowledged [Michael
> Clayton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelwilliamclayton/), Chief
> Technology Officer at **LevelField** , a U.S. challenger bank.

Although banks can potentially offer excellent security when custodying
digital assets, this cannot come at the expense of agility, a traditional
strength of the fintechs and Wave 1 service providers.

> _“Our view is that the source of future competitive advantage, for all
> institutions that enter the space, is to operate with no trade-offs. You
> need to have the ability to have high agility, flexibility,**and** (not
> “or”) to be highly secure and compliant.“_
>
> said Seamus Donoghue, Chief Growth Officer at Metaco.
